## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Introduction > Qu’est-ce qu’un miroir ?

**Âme:**
Je suis en grande angoisse
Et en peine et en angoisse
Pour l'anéantissement
De ma franchise et courtoisie.

**Raison:**
Ne te plains pas, je te prie,
Car Amour te délivrera
De cette peine et angoisse.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Introduction > Genre littéraire - Mise en scène - Lire au Moyen Age

Medieval literature is rich with several hundred "Mirrors" of all kinds: Mirrors of nature, Mirrors of history, Mirrors of morality, all of which have in common the aim of "reflecting" this or that aspect of reality to the eyes of a reader who is first and foremost a spectator[^1]. This means that a Mirror is much more than a modern book: a reflection of reality, it also aims to reflect the one who looks at it; or rather, it will allow the coincidence of the two through an inner transformation of a sacramental order to which the book in the Middle Ages could aspire.

We must forget here the invention of printing and the massive distribution of texts in the form of manufactured products that we passively digest in the silence of our reading rooms: the book in the 13th century is a rare and costly object, scarcely distributed outside religious communities or nascent universities.

As for reading, it is almost a profession as well; the notation of the text in the 13th century remains imprecise and leaves the reader a considerable margin of interpretation, somewhat like a Gregorian musical score. As a result, even individual reading is very generally vocal, and thus rhythmic, expressive, slow, public by its very nature. Here we see the outline of a whole scenic play whose distribution through the roles of our Mirror will only be an accentuation. The recipients are moreover designated sometimes as readers, sometimes as listeners, or better: as "listeners who will read this book" (ch. 37)! This ambiguity, a reflection of the situation of the book in the 13th century, is not unique to our Mirror: it can be identified throughout many contemporary texts as an address to the public beyond the sole proper readers.

Before going any further, we can ask here what importance should be attributed to the almost theatrical staging of the Mirror, and notably to the respective roles of Reason, Love, the soul, etc., intervening as distinct proclaimers. The question actually touches on the birth of European theater, the "mysteries" represented at the doors of cathedrals as well as the oratorical jousts of the chivalric "courts of love". Reconstructing the exact conditions of the proclamation of the Mirror is impossible and would clash with the most divergent theories of specialists on these questions.

Let us simply note that the length of the text forbids imagining its pure and simple representation on stage, and that its difficulty forbids imagining it having a large and unprepared audience; let us also note the flatness of the scenic play despite interludes occupied by true verbal juggling, and we will agree that we are in the presence of a text intended to be read by several, conventionally borrowing the form of an elementary theater in vogue at the time, this form eventually disappearing, as we will see, towards the last chapters. The process is not isolated: the personification of Virtues, of Reason or of Love as so many actors, facilitated by the general economy of the article in the languages of the time, is most widespread in medieval literature and governs, for example, the entire structure of the *Roman de la Rose*.

That said, the medieval book itself is not yet a Mirror. The word carries a very strong visual connotation and contains, as we have said, an invitation to mirror oneself to get closer to an admired reality; what is at stake here is the Platonic, but above all Christian conception of knowledge: it is contemplation and not action that transforms and assimilates to the contemplated object; "Because we will see God, we will be like Him," says Saint John to explain the beatitude of the elect. Thus, the Mirror of simple souls is also the one that makes the soul simple.

Now, if the book is no longer today what it was, the mirror from which ours takes its name is no longer either! The ancient mirror presents itself as an object of polished and shimmering metal, rare and expensive as well, with multiple and variable reflections, very far from our modern mirrors and their functional clarity. When Saint Paul opposes the knowledge of God here below "in a mirror, enigmatically," to the clear vision of the beyond, he clearly shows the ambiguous play of a mysterious object that hides as much as it reveals: it is through laborious accommodation — the monastic rumination of the text — that this mirror gradually focuses all our faculties of knowing and loving. By this means, in the mortal conditions that are ours, its function will be to introduce us to the contemplative universe, that of the Word of God in whom all things come to life, Himself the mirror of the Father giving life to all things: "Alas! alas! my child! mirror that delighted my heart and in which I have so often contemplated myself with joy!" Suso makes the Virgin Mary say at the foot of the cross. Such a contemplative intention will be at the heart of our Mirror, and forgetting it would lead to serious misunderstandings.

A contemplative point of view

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Introduction > Destinataires - L’expérience mystique - Une impossible lecture théologique

""I beg you by love: listen with great application to this subtle understanding that is within you... Otherwise, all those who hear this will misunderstand it" (Prologue). We are thus warned from the first page of the *Mirror*, and its author will not cease to renew this warning thereafter, undoubtedly in vain since he will lose his life and the honor of his orthodoxy over it! The *Mirror* is not written for everyone: "I say this to those for whom Love has made this book... But you who are nothing, ... you would waste your effort trying to understand it" (ch. 84). And if it is not written for everyone, it is not because it is reserved for adepts of the occult sciences, but because it supposes that Love himself gives the reader the understanding through a free and highly personal election (ch. 13), failing which, "because of their simplistic way of understanding, other creatures... would receive harm from it" (ch. 17)."

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Introduction > Quelle est cette expérience particulière sous-jacente au Miroir ? Elle n’est pas

that of Reason, of Virtues, or of Holiness (ch. 88), "not against the Virtues, but above them" (ch. 103), not the daughter of Holiness, but the mother of Holiness (ch. 88). She is in contact with God "without intermediary" (cf. ch. 64), "without any why" (cf. ch. 81, note 1), she is, within the very Trinity, the immediate experience of the birth of God in the heart of man, the experience of the Word becoming flesh in us (cf. ch. 80, note 3; 85, note 2; 115, note 1; ch. 42; etc.), a Christian experience if ever there was one, even if not all Christians have this experience, for while all are part of "Holy-Church-the-Little" (little for spiritual life, but not for number), only a few are part of "Holy-Church-the-Great" which holds the key: "These souls [= Holy-Church-the-Great] are properly called Holy-Church in that they support, teach, and nourish all Holy-Church; and not they, but the entire Trinity through them" (ch. 43). It is indeed the same Church, but according to two states of awareness: "Reason remains in us, but Love remains in them" (id.), says the Little to the Great. From one to the other, we see throughout the Mirror an inversion of the experimental flow that ceases to ascend with effort from effects to causes to grasp everything at its root as a free gift of a bottomless love, and this according to an intensity and lucidity that we are then told are "an ocean of Joy, ... an ocean of delights that flow and stream from the Divinity; ... this soul... is joy itself, and thus it swims and flows in joy without feeling any joy, for it remains in Joy and Joy remains in it: it is joy itself by the force of Joy that has transformed it into itself" (ch. 28).

This radical experience of God, the one found in Ruusbroec, Catherine of Siena, John of the Cross, or Thérèse of the Child Jesus, a more modern terminology calls a mystical experience. It is not a matter here of describing it—we provide the essential elements of such a description throughout our notes—but of affirming it and affirming that it is this that the Mirror explores, even if this exploration can only be done from the outside, that is, under the mediated jurisdiction of Reason which allows dissociation, and thus articulation, of what the immediate experience of Love continually tends to associate, and thus to silence, for better enjoyment: "These creatures can no longer speak of God, for, no more than they can say where God is, can they say WHO God is. Indeed, whoever speaks of God when he wants, to whom he wants, and where he wants to speak, must know without any doubt that he has never felt the true heart of divine love...; these souls are accustomed to understand much and to forget everything because of the subtlety of their lover" (ch. 18).

Unfortunately, this experience of Love will be easily denied by the jealous Reason, for lack of modesty, for lack of this virtue that it preaches and which would have conferred all its nobility if it had put it into practice by faithfully protecting the sleep of lovers (ch. 65). Here we can guess the conflict that all spirituals have announced and which carries the germ of the condemnation of the Mirror and its author, perfectly anticipated in chapter 85. And yet, in the name of Reason, let us listen here to an intelligent censor of the Free Spirit a century after the Mirror, Chancellor Gerson, the foremost intellectual authority of his time: "Scholastic men, even without inner experience, can properly treat writings of inner experience and mystical theology, provided they give them credit." Indeed, "as no one knows the things of the spirit except the spirit that is in him [allusion to I Co 2, 11], those who do not want to believe until they understand are unfit and absolutely incapable of hearing mystical theology" (De Mystica Theologia, trat. I, cons. 8 and 5).

For lack of this modesty, which nevertheless authorizes any reasonable man to read the Mirror without necessarily sharing the experience, the courts of the Inquisition will send our text and its author to the stake. Tracing now their double historical path will allow us to illustrate through a remarkable case this always open trial—in fact but not in law—of Reason against Love, of a false theology against a true mysticism.

A long trial that still continues
The milieu of the beguines. Marguerite Porete and the Mirror. Spirituality and courtesy
Marguerite Porete will be designated as a "beguine" in the acts of her trials, and her spiritual kinship with the most famous among them, Hadewijch of Antwerp or Beatrice of Nazareth for example, is evident from their literary proximity as well as from the little we know of her life. In the 1280s, the word beguine could designate either members of beguinal communities in the strict sense—which seems to be the usage of the Mirror in chapter 122—or, following a devaluation of the word throughout the 13th century, any person leading a spiritual life of some intensity in the practice of evangelical counsels. Both groups have in common their escape from traditional canonical forms of religious life and are regularly confined by opinion, as well as by ecclesiastical authorities, to the heretical limits of spiritual freedom, if not formally of the Free Spirit, in more or less close dependence on the Cathar and Waldensian movements. It is among them that all the religious vitality of the northern countries from the 12th to the 14th century seems to concentrate: not only Hadewijch and Beatrice, but Marie of Oignies, Ides of Nivelles, Saint Lutgard, and probably Marguerite Porete herself, are to be connected to the beguinal current, though to varying degrees of belonging. At the time of the Mirror, the great homeland of the beguines is constituted by the Rhineland countries, even if their diffusion throughout Europe can then be observed.

The original independence of the beguines made them particularly vulnerable to ecclesiastical trials from the 12th to the 14th century, the end of Marguerite Porete being a characteristic example; thus their protection will be organized—with an inevitable loss of autonomy—in two directions: on the one hand, a "federation" of the beguines among themselves leads from the beginning of the 13th century to these sorts of villages enclosed in the heart of the northern cities that are the "beguinages"; a certain communal life—living in small individual houses or larger convents, works of charity, work, infirmary, teaching—takes shape under the vigilance of one of them, the "great lady" (Hadewijch probably was one). The beguinage thus becomes a legal, economic, and soon canonical entity, with its resources, exemptions, but also social constraints unknown to the first generations. On the other hand, the protection of new religious congregations, of a fairly similar original inspiration—protection of the Norbertines then the Cistercians in the 12th century, the Dominicans and the Franciscans at the time of the Mirror—the efforts of churchmen such as Jacques de Vitry and Thomas of Cantimpré in the 1210s, lead to a desirable recognition and an inevitable integration of beguinal life within medieval institutions. But here we see the danger of having to choose one day or another between the initial independence of the beguines and this finally acquired stability: gradually, notably under the severe condemnations of the 14th century which will strike both Master Eckhart or a simple Marguerite Porete as well as genuine sectarians of the Free Spirit, beguinal life will tend to take on reassuring canonical forms, in mendicant third orders or by adopting the rule of Saint Augustine for example, with conditions of survival and renewal very diverse from one region to another.

The identification of the beguine Marguerite Porete as the author of the Mirror of Simple Souls is a recent acquisition of the history of spirituality, due to Romana Guarnieri in 1946. We can only refer the reader to her considerable work for the precise chronology of the text and its author, at least for the little we know. We will only give here necessary points of reference at the heart of a spiritual tradition that is not that of the heterodox currents that form the "Free Spirit"—to which Marguerite Porete has generally been attached—but that of the great classics of Nordic mysticism in the 13th and 14th centuries.

Marguerite Porete's birth can be situated around 1250 in Hainaut, perhaps in Valenciennes, a city that seems to be hers through her trials, even if the last of them will lead her to Paris where she will be burned alive in 1310. Historically and geographically, she thus belongs as much to the Germanic world as to the Latin world. Her language is French, but a careful reading of the Mirror notes many Flemishisms, indicators of a nearby linguistic border. Her excellent knowledge of contemporary Flemish mysticism also suggests that she probably knew how to share its language. Religiously, she belongs to the diocese of Cambrai, then covering a depth of twenty leagues along the right bank of the Scheldt, from its source to Antwerp, a situation that will involve, through the successive instances of her trials, a judicial itinerary passing through the Rhineland countries—and here we see a community of destiny with Master Eckhart on the side of Cologne—before ending in Paris.

Spiritually and culturally, we still encounter Marguerite Porete at a crossroads: the Mirror is teeming with implicit references—and thus difficult to spot—to the Latin patristic tradition, to secular courtly literature, but especially to the beguinal tradition. We will highlight one or another in our notes, but it is a climate, more than clear references, except for numerous quasi-biblical quotations. Undoubtedly, Marguerite Porete was a cultured woman, not of a scholastic and ostentatious culture, but of a science as deep as it is discreet, worthy of her predecessors of half a century, Hadewijch or Beatrice: we feel in her the same impregnation of the Victorine school, of Saint Bernard and William of Saint-Thierry; we feel her especially involved in the same chivalrous conquest of "Fin Amour"—the "emprise" of chapter 118: the fervor and intrepidity of the Mirror, without a male example at the time, breathe the "rage of loving" of the first two, in defiance of all scholastic conventions and to the benefit of a mystical extension of a waning courtly literature. The only question of Marguerite Porete, a woman of the 13th century, is that of love, of Love "ut sic," and without modern distinctions between good and bad, for "Love is God, and God is Love" (ch. 21).

It is important to be aware here of the courtly component that lends its vocabulary and staging to the Mirror and to a whole part of the surrounding spiritual literature. The framework of the Mirror, let us note, is the Romance of Alexander (cf. Prologue, note 4), and courtesy is one of the important protagonists of the scenic play. The word itself covers all the qualities of the courtly man (the "curialitas" of the Latin versions of the text), as opposed to the villain (an opposition echoed several times in the Mirror); and this at a time when court life rests less on warrior realities than on the pursuit and definition of Pure Love (Fénelon would not exhaust the subject four centuries later!). If courtesy still characterizes an art of living made of politeness and chivalrous generosity (the same attributed to Alexander the Great), it then indicates above all a will to pursue to the end, theoretically and practically, the fullness of the amorous experience. Fin Amour is thus the proper object of courtly pursuit, and the Mirror regularly qualifies the simple and annihilated soul as the one who "demands Pure Love." In the first courtly literature, that of the troubadours of the langue d'oc, Fin Amour is the fruit of the intrepid fidelity of the lover in all the trials imposed by his lady (the fruit of the "jovens"), and its characteristic is Joy, a conquering enthusiasm as well as a feeling linked to the complete possession of the loved object. In the northern courtesy inherited by the Mirror, these notions are spiritualized and internalized, but without losing any of their strength, ready for the use that Hadewijch will make of them (the "minne fijn" is correlated with the "orewoet," the "rage of loving"), in the line of transpositions already made by Saint Bernard and William of Saint-Thierry.

It is within this framework that we must now specify the trajectory of the Mirror and Marguerite Porete. It is around the tumultuous appearance of the work in the 1290s that we can organize what we know about it.
From the beguinage to the stake.
The Mirror through the centuries
What the reception of the Mirror was like can be guessed in its chapter 122: "The beguines declare that I am lost, and so do the priests, the clerics, and the preachers, the Augustinians, the Carmelites, and the friars minor...!" Faced with this coalition, there is every reason to believe that Marguerite Porete did not refuse the fight, and we know that she did what was necessary to obtain an unofficial but important approval of her work, the one that appears at the head of some of its Latin and English versions. She owed it to Godefroid of Fontaines, former regent at the faculty of theology of Paris in the years 1285-1286, and to two other censors difficult to identify, one of whom we know was attached to the Brabantine Cistercian family (and who can therefore be supposed to be a spiritual son of Saint Bernard and William of Saint-Thierry, so present in the Mirror), the other attached to the Franciscan family of the friars minor. But despite this approval, the bishop of Cambrai will condemn the Mirror in 1300, have it publicly burned in Valenciennes, and threaten its author with recourse to the secular arm in case of recidivism.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Introduction > Cette récidive ne tarda guère : nous savons qu’en 1306-1307, Marguerite Porete

sent copies of the *Miroir* to various notables, notably to the bishop of Châlons-sur-Marne, perhaps in the hope of seeing the initial approval reinforced. In any case, the result was new denunciations and a new diocesan trial, while the bishop of Cambrai was now Philippe de Marigny, the damned soul of Philippe le Bel, one of his accomplices in the persecution of the Templars; the higher judicial authority brought Marguerite Porete before the Inquisition of Haute-Lorraine, and from there before the Inquisition of Paris, in the hands of Guillaume de Paris, also perfectly compromised by Philippe le Bel in the fight against the Templars. It is in the face of these executioners that one must evaluate the attitude of the prisoner: refusal to take an oath of loyalty — a prerequisite for the trial's instruction — which would have made her a collaborator of an iniquitous apparatus; refusal, then, to receive absolution for faults she maintained she had not committed. It is clear that this double refusal cannot be purely and simply identified with a refusal of the ecclesiastical institution as such and its sacraments. Nevertheless, excommunicated for so much obstinacy but unshakable in her good faith — because undoubtedly unshakable in her faith —, Marguerite "of Hainaut, called Porete," was declared a relapsed heretic on May 30, 1310, after an examination of the *Miroir* by a commission of theologians. She was handed over the next day to the secular arm to be publicly burned with the incriminated work, and the execution took place on June 1 in the Place de Grève; the account we have mentions, as in all such circumstances, the dignity of the victim, the harshness of the punishment, the tears of the crowd, and the inevitable last-minute attempts by admirers.

But the history of the *Miroir* does not end with that of its author. Its theological dossier was then transferred to Vienne, in Dauphiné, where the famous council that would massively condemn northern mysticism, especially that of Meister Eckhart and that of the *Miroir*, generally confused with the deviations of the Free Spirit sects, would take place in 1311-1312. What remains of the acts of the various trials, as well as the articles of the Council of Vienne, shows the extent of the misunderstanding. Basically, where Marguerite Porete speaks of transcending virtue and morality, her judges read an opposition to virtue; where she speaks of union with God, they read an identification with God; where she speaks of inner peace, they read a perverse nihilism; where she speaks of worshiping God in spirit and truth, they understand it as a sacrilegious renunciation of Christian institutions.

None of Marguerite Porete's own warnings were of any use, none of her professions of Catholic faith in the *Miroir* (in chapters 14-15, for example), not even her clearest affirmations on THE NECESSITY FOR MAN TO DO HIS PART IN ALL THAT PERTAINS TO REASON, THE PART OF LOVE BEING THAT OF GOD AND HIM ALONE: "I make known to all who will hear this book, that we must reproduce in ourselves as much as we can — through devout thoughts, through works of perfection, through the demands of Reason — all the life that Jesus Christ led and preached to us... This, we must do to have victory over ourselves. And if we did it as much as we could, we would come to possess it while putting out of ourselves all thoughts, all works of perfection, and all the demands of Reason, for we would have no need of them: divinity would then operate in us, for ourselves and without ourselves, its divine works" (ch. 113).

In each condemnation, it is clear that what we have called the "contemplative point of view" is at stake, and that Marguerite Porete's judges consider, in terms of liberation from the Law, only the immoral libertinism of the sects of the time, an avalanche of black masses, abominable sacrifices, and fornication.

Whatever the spirituality, the historian notes here that the condemnation of the Council of Vienne will henceforth assimilate the *Miroir* to a heretical work, regularly confiscated by the Inquisitions throughout Europe until the Renaissance, eloquent testimony to its success and diffusion. And this reputation will be received without further examination by almost all modern works, admittedly few in number, which will marginally mention the *Miroir* among the witnesses of beguine spirituality.

The reputation of heresy and the small number of manuscripts that survived the confiscations have indeed certainly led to underestimating the importance of the *Miroir* in modern research. But that it enjoyed great success during its author's lifetime and afterward is evident both from the impressive staging of its trials — all the authorities of the Sorbonne participated —, the efforts of the Inquisition to stop its circulation, but especially from its traces in later spiritual literature, both orthodox and heretical — but does not heresy itself use the Gospel? This diffusion first brought the *Miroir* across the Channel, translated as early as the first half of the 14th century in the Carthusian monasteries of England along with other texts of similar inspiration. It was then found circulating in Latin and Italian around 1430 in northern Italy, where Saint Bernardino of Siena, Saint Laurence Giustiniani, Saint John of Capistrano, and many others tried to stop the progress of the Free Spirit, unfortunately without taking the time to examine case by case the validity of previous condemnations while introducing the best of northern spirituality into southern Europe. And thus, alongside a French tradition, Latin, English, and Italian traditions of the *Miroir* emerged. What must not be forgotten in their formation is the extraordinarily complex nature of the orthodox and heterodox currents with which they were then associated. We can only refer here to the whole question of sects in the Middle Ages, from the Bulgarians to the Spanish Alumbrados, passing through the Cathars, in constant interference with the most solid mystical traditions. Every reader of Suso, Ruusbroec, or Eckhart senses in them the fear of possible confusions, the pressure of an ever-watchful Inquisition, the weight of words understood differently by the accusers and the accused, the weight, above all, of politico-religious interests infinitely surpassing mere doctrinal concerns. We are at the heart of a problem that absolutely all of Europe is the stage for. It is out of the question to analyze it here; many elements, valid from a historical point of view, have been gathered by Romana Guamieri in the already cited work. Nor is it a question of undertaking here a point-by-point rehabilitation of the *Miroir* that would interest only specialists; — we reserve it possibly for another publication —: we will content ourselves with highlighting the most sensitive points in our notes, the debate having significantly deflated over seven centuries, simply because there is nothing more to gain in heresy today! What the modern reader will retain from the *Miroir* is no longer a possible liberation from ecclesiastical structures, but a liberation from oneself, it is the rage for the absolute we mentioned earlier, the peace it brings beyond all anguish, the certainty of being loved, even to the heart of hell if necessary.

Reading the *Miroir*
The sufferings of a translator
Rendering the *Miroir* into modern French is a source of despair, and we feel we have transformed the shimmering object mentioned earlier into a product as anonymous as industrial glass. This is because our *Miroir* is also such by its style: it casts its lights in multiple directions and juxtaposes its facets rather than developing a theme linearly. Its progress will be to associate images, not to chain arguments; hence the disorientation of a first reading, especially since the author clearly enjoys multiplying optical illusions as if to invite us to continually surpass the fragile victories of Reason over Love: her art, very feminine, is that of a lace-maker inventing endless twists, turns, and reprises ("I sing and I unsing," says the soul in chapter 80), without much concern for the reader's impatience and at the risk of having her preciousness mistaken for esotericism.

A first difficulty comes from the fact that the primary meaning of the text often escapes numerous readings or re-readings, without one ever knowing very well whether a material corruption of the text is at fault, or simply the author's taste for the most convoluted verbal constructions. In the most difficult cases, or during truly untranslatable wordplays, we modestly transcribe the original in a note, often without comment, hoping that the reader will be more skillful than us. Similarly, we have transcribed the two little poems placed at the beginning and end of the text to preserve some of its medieval flavor.

Next, it is practically impossible to render the oral and declamatory quality of the text, whose importance we mentioned for the 13th century; the variations in its rhythm, the concentrations of assonances in places, cannot be fully respected; repetitions like those transcribed in notes 6 and 7 of the Prologue are practically untranslatable. Moreover, modern grammar no longer admits the rich ambiguities of medieval imprecisions: changing eras within a language is always more delicate than changing languages within an era.

Finally, an inevitable devaluation of vocabulary over the centuries has forced us to choose from the richness of certain words; all the courteous charge of part of the spiritual vocabulary, notably, disappears when one translates, for example, "franchise" by "Freedom," or "villenie" by "insult," translations that are nevertheless difficult to avoid. What to say, finally, of the irreducible change of gender, and therefore of sex, of the main character of the *Miroir*, that is to say, of Love, feminine in the 13th century, masculine since? And it is all the relationships of the scenic play that are affected without possible correction.

Original text and translations
We have sketched above the conditions of diffusion of the *Miroir*. Few copies have reached us through successive campaigns of destruction, too few to allow the necessary cross-checks to establish a critically uncontestable starting text. In the current state of things, we possess thirteen nearly complete manuscripts of the *Miroir*, one French, three English, four Latin, five Italian. Compared to the others, the French manuscript (Condé F XIV 26 of Chantilly) clearly testifies to a state of the text very little accommodated and corrected, very close to the original (and we will designate it as such in our notes for simplicity), while the others too regularly suppress the literary or doctrinal difficulties of the French text to be used without reservations. Among them, only the English and three of the Latin seem to translate directly from the original French, the others re-translating from Latin or English. Thus, we proceeded as follows in our own translation into modern French: we used almost exclusively the Chantilly text in the diplomatic edition given by Romana Guamieri; in case of a manifest gap — notably for chapters 134 to 137 missing due to the binding of the Chantilly manuscript and which Romana Guamieri then gives in Latin — or an inextricable difficulty (the *Miroir* does not lack them!), we first consulted the direct Latin versions (currently preserved in three manuscripts of the Vatican Library; we generally used Rossiano 4), and then the English version in the edition given by Clara Kirchberger (*The Mirror of Simple Souls*, London, 1927). We will always note these deviations from the Chantilly text.

Stage directions and characters
In the original, the designation of the interlocutors and some stage directions or author's remarks appear at the head of the replies and are generally repeated throughout the text (e.g., "Love: Such a Soul, says Love,..."), interrupting and considerably burdening it. We have systematically grouped these indications at the head of the replies, detaching them typographically. When they are purely and simply repeated throughout the reply, we have not repeated them; conversely, when they are missing, we have added them in brackets, with a note when the attribution to such or such interlocutor seems questionable.

Moreover, the degree of personification of courtesy, charity, faith, virtue, etc., is not always clear: we will play on the use of uppercase and lowercase letters (for example: courtesy and Courtesy) without claiming to have always chosen correctly.

Some reference points in the vocabulary
Finally, we think we can save the reader time by grouping here some key expressions of the *Miroir*. The text having little plan (it "shimmers"), it is in relation to a general diffuse scheme of spiritual life that one must orient oneself, a scheme essentially constituted by the seven states and the three lives of the soul. The following table distributes the fundamental spiritual vocabulary of the *Miroir* according to the place it occupies in this whole.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Prologue

The soul, touched by God and stripped of sin in the first state of grace,
has ascended through divine graces to the seventh state of grace, a state where it
possesses its perfection in fullness in the land of life through divine enjoyment.
Love says here: O you, active and contemplative, perhaps even annihilated by
true love, you who are about to hear some of the wonders of
pure love, of noble love, of the elevated love of the liberated soul[^1], you who are about
to hear how the Holy Spirit has set its sail[^2] in it as in its ship, I
beseech you by love: listen with great application of that subtle understanding
which is in you, and with great diligence! Otherwise, for lack of being so disposed,
all those who hear this will understand it poorly.
Now, understand with humility a simple example, borrowed from worldly love,
and apply it similarly to divine love:
There was once a young lady, daughter of a king, with a great and noble heart, with noble
courage as well, and she lived in a foreign land. Now it happened that
this young lady heard of the great courtesy and great nobility
of King Alexander, and immediately her will loved him for his great renown as a
gentleman. But she lived so far from this great lord in whom she had
placed her love, that she could neither see him nor have him, and she was
often desolate within herself, for no other love than this one satisfied her. When she saw that this distant love, while being so close within her,
was so far outside, this young lady thought to console her sorrow by imagining
some figure of the beloved whose heart often wounded her. So she
had an image painted in the likeness of the king she loved, as close
as possible to what she imagined in her love, and according to the affection of
the love that overwhelmed her; and thanks to this image and by other artifices, she
thought of the king himself.
The soul who had this book written: But yes, truly! This is indeed what I mean:
I heard of a king of great power, who was in courtesy, in very great courtesy of nobility and generosity, a noble Alexander. But he was
so far from me, and I was so far from him, that I could find no comfort
within myself; and to remember him, he gave me this book which
represents in some way his love. But although I have his image, I am nonetheless in a foreign land, far from the palace where dwell the very noble
friends of this lord, those who are completely pure, refined, and freed thanks to
the gifts of the king with whom they dwell.
The author: That is why we will tell you how Our Lord is not at all freed from
Love, while Love is freed from him for us, so that
humble people may hear it on the occasion of what is intended for you, for
Love can do everything without harming anyone.
And Love speaks thus for you: There are seven states of nobility, which the creature
receives if it disposes itself to all to come to the one that is perfect; and we
will tell you how by the end of this book.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 3. Où Amour parle des commandements de Sainte-Eglise

**Love:** We will begin here with the commandments of Holy Church, so that everyone may find their nourishment in this book with the help of God, who commands us to love Him with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our strength, to love ourselves as we ought, and to love our neighbor as ourselves 1.

Firstly, to love Him with all our heart: that is to say, that our thoughts are always truly on Him; with all our soul: that is to say, that we never speak anything but the truth, even if we must die for it; with all our strength: that we do all our works purely for Him; ourselves as we ought: that we do not consider our own profit in this, but the perfect will of God; and our neighbor as ourselves: that we do not do, think, or say anything towards our neighbor that we would not want him to do, think, or say towards us. These commandments are necessary for everyone's salvation: without them, no one can find grace.

Note here the example of the young man saying to Jesus Christ that he had kept these commandments since his childhood; Jesus Christ answered him: "You need to do one thing if you want to be perfect: go, sell all your goods and give them to the poor; then follow me, and you will have a treasure in heaven 2." This is the counsel of all perfection in virtues, and whoever adheres to it well will remain in true charity.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 4. De la noble vertu de Charité, et comment elle n’obéit qu’à

Love 1
**Love:** Charity obeys nothing created, but only Love.
Charity has nothing of its own, and supposing it had something, it does not
claim it as its own.
Charity leaves its own work to go do that of others.
Charity asks no reward from any creature, whatever good or pleasure
it may do for them.
Charity feels neither shame, nor fear, nor sorrow; it is so upright that it cannot
bend, whatever may happen to it.
Charity neither does nor considers anything that is under the sun; the whole world
is but its excess and its remains.
Charity gives to all that which it possesses, and it does not hold itself back; and
with that, it often promises what it does not have, because of its great generosity,
in the hope that more remains to the one who gives more.
Charity is such a shrewd merchant, that it gains everywhere, where others lose,
and it escapes the bonds in which others are caught; and thus it has
great abundance of what pleases Love.
And note that he who would have perfect charity would be put to death by the work of
Charity regarding the affections of life according to the spirit.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 5. De la vie qui s’appelle « paix de charité en vie anéantie »

**Love:** But there is another life, which we call "peace of charity in annihilated life." It is of this that we wish to speak[^1], asking that one may find
I 2    a soul
II    that is saved by faith and without works,
III    that is only in Love,
IV    that does nothing because of God,
V    that forsakes nothing because of God,
VI    to whom nothing can be taught,
VII    from whom nothing can be taken away
VIII    nor given,
IX    and that has no will.
Alas! who then will give this soul what it needs? for it has never been nor will it ever be given!
This soul has six wings, like the Seraphim[^2]. It no longer wants anything that comes through an intermediary, which is the state proper to the Seraphim: there is
no intermediary between their love and divine love. They always receive its message without an intermediary: likewise, this soul receives it, for it does not
seek divine knowledge among the masters of this age, but in true contempt of the world and of itself. My God! how great is the difference between
a gift that the beloved makes to his beloved through an intermediary, and one that he makes without an intermediary!
This book speaks the truth of this soul well, in saying that it has six wings like the Seraphim. With two wings it covers the face of Jesus Christ Our Lord;
that is to say, the more this soul has knowledge of divine goodness, the more perfectly it knows that it knows nothing of it compared to a single spark
of its real goodness, for it is grasped[^3] only by itself. With two other wings, it covers its feet; that is to say, the more it has knowledge of what Jesus
Christ suffered for us, the more perfectly it knows that it knows nothing of it compared to what he really suffered for us, for it is known only by
himself. With two other wings, the soul flies and stands both upright and seated; that is to say, all that it knows, loves, and praises of divine goodness, these are
the wings with which it flies; and it stands upright for it is always under the gaze of God, and seated for it always remains in the divine will.
Yes; and what or how would this soul have to fear? Certainly, it could neither fear nor dread anything: supposing it were in the world and
it were possible that the world, the flesh and the devil, the four elements[^4], the birds of the air and the wild beasts torment, tear apart or devour it,
it could still lose nothing if God remains with it, for he is all in all places, all-powerful, all wisdom and all goodness.
**Soul:** He is our father, our brother and our loyal friend. He is without
beginning, he is grasped[^5] by none but himself, he is without end,
three persons in one God. Such is the beloved of our souls.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 6. Comment l’âme amoureuse de Dieu, vivant en paix de charité,

takes leave of the Virtues
Love: The soul whose love is of this quality can say to the Virtues that she has been long and many days in their servitude.
The Soul: I confess it to you, sire Love: there was a time when I was, but now there is another; your desire has freed me from their servitude, and that is why I can now well say and sing this to them:
Virtues, I take leave of you forever:
My heart will be freer and happier for it.
Your service is too constant, I know it.
I once placed my heart in you, without reserving anything for myself;
You know that I was yours, entirely abandoned:
I was then your slave, now I am delivered from it.
I had placed all my heart in you, I know it:
I lived for a certain time, in great turmoil.
I suffered many grave torments, many endured pains;
It is a wonder that, absolutely, I have escaped alive.
But if it is so, I care little: I am weaned from you,
For which I thank the God above; this is a good day!
I have left your prison, where I was in much distress.
Never was I free, except separated from you;
I have left your prison: in peace I have remained.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 7. Comment cette âme est noble, et comment elle ne tient compte

**Love:** This soul takes no account of either shame or honor, neither poverty nor wealth, neither ease nor unease, neither love nor hate, neither hell nor paradise.
**Reason:** In the name of God, what does this mean, what you are saying there?
**Love:** What does it mean? Certainly, he knows, and no one else, to whom God has given understanding, for neither Scripture contains it, nor human wisdom comprehends it, nor the work of a creature allows it to be heard or understood, but this gift comes rather from the Most High in whom this creature is enraptured by the fullness of knowledge, and nothing remains in its understanding. Then this soul, having become nothing, possesses everything and yet possesses nothing, it wants everything and wants nothing, it knows everything and knows nothing.
**Reason:** But what can it be, sire Love, that this soul can want what this book says, when it has said before that it has no will?
**Love:** Reason, it is not its will that wants it, but rather it is the will of God that wants it in it; for it is not this soul that remains in Love, which would make it want that by some desire, but rather it is Love that remains in it, which has taken its will, and that is why it does its will through it; then Love operates in it without itself, so much so that there is no unease that can remain in it.
This soul can no longer speak of God, for it is annihilated in all its external desires, in its internal way of feeling and in all affection of spirit, to the extent that it does what it does by the exercise of a good habit or by a commandment of Holy Church, without any desire, for the will that desire gave it is dead.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 8. Comment Raison s’étonne de ce que cette âme ait délaissé les

Virtues, and how Love praises them
Reason, who understands only coarse things and leaves the finest: Love,
what is this marvel? This soul has no sense of grace nor desire
of spirit, since it has taken leave of the Virtues who teach the way of living
well to every good soul. Certainly, without these Virtues, no one can be saved nor come to
the perfect life, and he who possesses them cannot be deceived; nevertheless, this
soul takes leave of them! But is she not foolish, the soul who speaks thus?
**Love:**
But certainly not! Indeed, such souls possess the Virtues better than any other creature; but they do not practice them, for they no longer belong to them, contrary to their habit: they have been slaves to them enough to be henceforth freed.
**Reason:**
But, Love, when then were they slaves?
**Love:**
When they remained in your love and in your obedience, Lady
Reason, and also in those of the other Virtues; and by remaining there, they have
been freed from them.
**Reason:**
And when then were these souls freed?
**Love:**
They are freed when Love dwells in them and the Virtues serve them without any contradiction or effort on their part. But
surely, Reason, the souls who have been thus freed have known on many
occasions what Domination can do, and to those who would ask them what is the greatest torment a creature can suffer, they would answer that it is to remain in Love while being under the obedience of the Virtues. Indeed, it
is fitting to give the Virtues all that they ask, whatever it may cost
Nature; but it is so that the Virtues demand honor and possession,
heart, body, and life; in other words, while these souls forsake all things,
the Virtues still say to the one who has given them all that and has kept nothing to
comfort Nature, that with great difficulty the just is saved! So much so that this soul
exhausted but still a slave to the Virtues, says that she would rather be
governed by Fear and tormented in hell until judgment, if she were to
be saved afterwards!
This is true. Such is the subjection in which the soul lives upon which the Virtues have
power. But the souls of which we speak have put the Virtues in their place, for
they do nothing for the Virtues: rather, it is the Virtues that do all that
these souls want, without domination or contradiction, for these souls are their
mistresses.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 9. Comment ces âmes n’ont point de volonté propre

**Love:**  
To anyone who would ask them if they would want to be in purgatory, these free, assured, and peaceful souls would answer no; if they would want to have in this life the certainty of their salvation, they would answer no; or if they would want to be in paradise, they would answer no.  
But then, what would they want? They have no will, and if they wanted anything, they would separate themselves from Love; for the one who holds their will knows what is good for them, and that suffices for them, without knowing it and without more assurance.  
These souls live by knowledge, love, and praise[^1]: such is their habitual exercise without moving by themselves, for Knowledge, Love, and Praise dwell within them.  
These souls cannot find themselves good or bad, and they have no knowledge of themselves nor could they judge if they are on the right path or the wrong one.  
Or, to speak more briefly, let us take one soul among all, one that neither desires nor despises poverty and tribulation, mass and sermon, fasting and prayer, and that gives to Nature all that it needs without remorse of conscience: well! this Nature is so well ordered by the transformation of the union of Love to which the will of this soul is joined, that it asks for nothing that is forbidden.  
This soul does not worry about what it needs, except at the moment it is needed; but this worry, no one can lose it unless they are innocent.  

**Reason:**  
In the name of God, what does this mean?  

**Love:**  
To this, Reason, I answer you as I have already done, and I tell you once again: no master whose wisdom comes from Nature, nor any master in Scripture, nor any of those who remain in the love of obedience to Virtues, understand it nor will understand it where there is something to understand; be certain of it, Reason, for no one understands it, except only the one who pursues Perfect Love.  
Certainly, if by chance such souls were found, they would tell the truth if they wished; but do not think that anyone can understand them, except only the one who pursues Perfect Love and Charity.  
This gift is sometimes given in an instant: let the one who receives it take care of it, for it is the most perfect gift that God gives to a creature.  
This soul is in the school of Divinity; thus it sits in the valley of Humility and in the plain of Truth, and it rests on the mountain of Love.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 10. Comment, à la requête de Raison, Amour nomme cette âme par

twelve names for the use of the active

**Reason:** Well then! Love, name this soul by its proper name, and give
some knowledge of it to the active!

**Love:** She can be named by twelve names, namely:
the most marvelous; the unknown; the most innocent of the daughters of Jerusalem[^1];
the one upon whom the entire Holy Church is founded; the one illuminated by Knowledge;
the one adorned by Love; the one vivified by Praise; the one annihilated in all things by
humility; the one peaceful in divine state by divine will; the one who wants nothing
other than the divine will; the one who is accomplished and satisfied without any
failure by divine goodness, thanks to the operation of the Trinity;
her last name is: Oblivion.
These twelve names, Love gives to her.

**Pure Courtesy:** But certainly, it is quite right that she should be named thus,
for these are her rightful names.

**Reason:** There you go, Love; you have named this soul by many names; thereby
the active will have some knowledge of her, if only by hearing these very noble names.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 11. Comment, à la requête de Raison, Amour donne connaissance

of this soul to the contemplatives, by explaining nine points which were previously mentioned

**Reason:** Now, Love, in the name of the contemplatives, in the name of those who always desire to grow in divine knowledge and who are and remain in the desire of Love, I would ask you that by your courtesy, you explain the nine points you have already spoken of[^1], and which the soul pursuing Pure Love possesses, a soul in which Charity dwells and sits in a life annihilated that places it in the abandonment of Pure Love.

**Love:** Name them then, Reason!

**Reason, to Love:** The first point you spoke of is that such a soul cannot be found.

**Love:** That is true. That is to say, this soul knows in itself only one thing, namely the root of all its evils and the abundance of all its innumerable sins, without weight or measure. But sin is nothing, and this soul is completely collapsed and terrified by its horrible faults which are less than nothing; and in understanding this, it becomes less than nothing as far as it depends on it; from which one can conclude that this soul cannot be found. Indeed, it is so annihilated by humility, that in its just judgment, and if it were that God wanted to take vengeance for the thousandth part of a single one of its faults, no creature that ever sinned would deserve the torment and infinite confusion of which it sees itself worthy. This humility, and no other, is true and perfect humility in the annihilated soul.

The second point is that this soul is saved by faith and without works.

**Reason:** In the name of God, what does that mean?

**Love:** That is to say, this annihilated soul has in itself such great knowledge by the virtue of faith, and it is in itself so occupied with maintaining what Faith administers to it of the power of the Father, the wisdom of the Son, and the goodness of the Holy Spirit, that nothing created can remain in its memory without briefly passing due to this other occupation which has invested its understanding. This soul can no longer do works; thus it is certainly quite excused and justified, in believing without working that God is good without measure[^2]. This soul is saved by faith and without works, for Faith surpasses all works, according to the testimony of Love itself.

The third point is that it is alone in Love.

**Reason:** In the name of God, sire Love, what does that mean?

**Love:** That is to say, this soul finds neither comfort, nor affection, nor hope in any creature that God has created, neither in heaven nor on earth, but only in the goodness of God. Such a soul neither begs nor asks anything from creatures. It is like the Phoenix[^3], which is alone, for it is alone in Love, this soul which satisfies itself.

The fourth point is that this soul does nothing because of God.

**Reason:** In the name of God, what does that mean?

**Love:** That is to say that God has no need of its work, and that this soul has no need of anything, except what God needs. It does not care for itself; let God care for it, who loves it more than it loves itself! It has such great faith in God, that it is not afraid of being poor as long as its beloved is rich. Indeed, Faith teaches it that it will find God to the extent of its hope, and as it hopes by its faith that He is perfectly rich, it cannot be poor.

The fifth point is that this soul does not abandon, because of God, anything it can do.

**Reason:** In the name of God, Love, what does that mean?

**Love:** That is to say that it can do nothing other than the will of God; but it cannot want anything else either; and for that reason, it does not abandon anything because of God. Indeed, it lets nothing enter its thought that is opposed to God; and for that reason, it does not abandon anything because of God.

The sixth point is that nothing can be taught to it.

**Reason:** In the name of God, what does that mean?

**Love:** That is to say that this soul is of such great constancy, that if it had all the knowledge of all the creatures that ever were, that are and that will be, it would seem nothing to it compared to the one it loves, who was never known and never will be. This soul loves more what is in God, which was never given and never will be, than it loves what it has and what it would have if it were to have all the knowledge that all the creatures that are and will be will have.

**The Soul:** And yet it is nothing compared to what it really is, but nothing can be said about it.

**Love:** The seventh point is that nothing can be taken from it.

**Reason:** In the name of God, Love, tell us what that is!

**Love:** What is that? But what would be taken from it? Certainly, nothing could be taken from it, for whoever would take its honor from this soul, its wealth and its friends, its heart, its body and its life, that one would still take nothing from it if God remains to it; from which it follows that nothing can be taken from it, no matter the force applied.

The eighth point is that nothing can be given to it.

**Reason:** In the name of God, Love, what does that mean, that nothing can be given to it?

**Love:** What does that mean? But what would be given to it? If everything that was and ever will be given were given to it, it would still be nothing compared to what it loves and will love, except God Himself.

**The Soul:** Sire Love loves and will love in me.

**Love:** With all due respect, I am not there yet! (To the audience:) We will say that God loves more what surpasses this soul and is in Him, than what does not surpass it and that it is by itself[^4].

**The Soul responds:** But what does not surpass it is not, there is only the whole[^5]; and that, I can well say, and thus say the truth.

**Love:** I say more: if this soul had all the knowledge, all the love and all the praise that were and will ever be given by the divine Trinity, it would still be nothing compared to what it loves and will love; but it will never reach this love by way of knowledge.

**The Soul, to Love:** But certainly, dear Love, I will not reach even the smallest point of it without the help of what surpasses my love, for God is none other than the one of whom absolutely nothing can be known. Indeed, He alone is my God, of whom nothing can be said and of whom all the inhabitants of paradise cannot reach even a point, no matter the knowledge they have of Him. And in what thus surpasses Him, resides the greatest mortification of the love of my spirit; and that is now and forever, all the glory of the love of my soul, and that of all those who ever understood themselves. How small a thing it is to listen to, compared to the greatest, of which no one speaks! I would like to speak of it, but I do not know what to say. And yet, sire Love, my love is of such quality,
that I prefer to hear ill spoken of you in some way, rather than nothing being said at all. And that is indeed what I do: I speak ill of you, for all that I say of it is but speaking ill of your goodness; but you must forgive me my slander, for, Sire, he who always speaks of you, even if he never says anything of your goodness, speaks ill of you! That is what happens to me: I never stop speaking of you, in my questions or in my thoughts, or listening if something is said to me of your goodness; but the more I hear of you, the more I am astonished, for it would be a great injury to consider that I have understood because something was said to me of it. They are mistaken, indeed, those who believe it, for I am certain that nothing can be said of it, and if it pleases God, I will never be mistaken; what I want is never to hear lies about your divine goodness, but to accomplish the enterprise of this book of which Love is the master, who told me to put an end to all my enterprises in it. Indeed, as long as I question Love about something concerning him, I will lead a life according to the spirit[^6] in the shadow of the sun, where one can see the subtle images of the attractions of divine love of the divine generation.

[To Reason[^7]:]
But what am I saying? Assuming I possess all that has been said, it would certainly be nothing compared to what I love of Him, and which He will give to no one else but Himself, and which He must keep because of His divine justice. And it is therefore in truth that I say that nothing can be given to me, whatever it may be. But this complaint that you hear from me, lady Reason, it is my all and what I have best, if well understood. Ah! How sweet it is to understand! My God! Understand it fully, for paradise is nothing else but that.

**Love:** The ninth point, lady Reason, is that this soul has no will.

**Reason:** God of love! what are you saying? You say that this soul has no will?

**Love:** But certainly, for all that this soul wants in consenting to it, is what God wants it to want, and it wants it to fulfill the will of God and not its own; and it cannot want it by itself, but it is the will of God that wants it in it; from which it follows that this soul has no will without the will of God which makes it want all that it must want.

Now, listen and understand well, listeners of this book, the true way to understand what it says in many places, namely that the annihilated soul has no will, nor can it have one, nor can it want to have one, and in this the divine will is perfectly accomplished; it also says that the soul is not satisfied with divine love nor is divine love satisfied with the soul, as long as the soul is not in God nor God in the soul, by itself and through itself; and in this divine manner of being, the soul then finds all its satisfaction.
**Understanding of Reason:**
It is true, but it seems that the ninth point says the exact opposite, for it says that the annihilated soul wants nothing beside what it would want to want; and this wanting, it cannot have, for God wants it to want that its wanting be nothing beside that which would satisfy it, which will never be given to it[^1].
**Reason:**
I understand in this that the soul wants to want and that God wants it to want a wanting that it cannot have, and from this comes that it fails and is not satisfied.
**Understanding of Reason:**
It seems to me, sire Love, that this ninth point makes me understand this by contradicting this book, for it holds as true that the liberated soul has no will, nor can it have one, nor can it want one, and that the divine Unity does not want it to have one, and that it thus has in all things — according to this book — full satisfaction through divine love.
**The Annihilated Soul:**
Hey! Understanding of Reason, you take it easy! You keep the straw and leave the grain[^2]! Indeed, your understanding is too low, and you cannot understand with enough elevation the state we are talking about. But Understanding of Divine Love, which dwells and abides in the annihilated and liberated soul, understands this well, and without obstacle, for it is in that state.
**His Highness the Understanding of Love:**
Now, Understanding of Reason, understand the grossness of your misunderstanding: if this annihilated soul wants the will of God — and the more it wants it, the more it would want to want it —, it still cannot have it, because of its smallness as a creature, for God keeps the greatness of his divine justice. And yet, God wants it to want this and to have this wanting, and this wanting is the divine will that gives its state to the free creature. This divine wanting that God makes it want, draws into it the waves of divine knowledge, and the marrow of divine love, and the union of divine praise, whereas the will of the soul stops them.
**Love:**
Also, how could the soul have a wanting, since Clear Knowledge knows that there is a state among all, the noblest of all, that the creature cannot possess except by wanting nothing?
Now, Reason has heard the answer to its questions, except to the one where it says that the liberated soul remains unsatisfied; and that is why I will tell it what this dissatisfaction consists of: it is to want the divine will, for the more one wants it, the less one finds satisfaction in it. And yet, this very wanting is the only will of God and the glory of the soul[^3].

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 13. Comment Raison est satisfaite de l’explication des choses

for the contemplatives and the active, but it still raises questions for common people
**Reason:**
Now, Love, you have condescended to our prayer, that is to say, you have explained the aforementioned things for the active and the contemplatives; but I would still ask you to explain them for the common people, some of whom may eventually reach this state. Indeed, there are several ambiguous words that are difficult for their understanding, and if you explained them, this book would show everyone the true light of truth and the perfection of charity, and also who are those whom God jealously chooses, calls, and loves supremely.
**Love:**
Reason, where then are these ambiguous words, which you ask me to distinguish and explain for the benefit of those for whom you make such a humble request, and also for those who will hear this book that we will call: "Mirror of Simple Souls who remain in will and desire"?
**Reason:**
I answer you to that, sire Love, that this book says very surprising things about this soul when it declares — it is in chapter seven — that this soul takes no account of either shame or honor, neither poverty nor wealth, neither ease nor discomfort, neither love nor hate, neither hell nor paradise. And with that, it declares that this soul has everything and has nothing, that it knows everything and knows nothing, that it wants everything and wants nothing, as it says above in chapter nine, so much so that it desires neither contempt nor poverty, nor martyrdom nor tribulations, nor masses nor sermons, nor fasts nor prayers, and that it gives to Nature everything she asks without remorse of conscience. Surely, Love, no one can understand this by my way of understanding, but it is from you that one learns it, thanks to your teaching. Indeed, according to my way of understanding, in my opinion and to give you my candid advice, the best I would advise would be to desire contempt, poverty, and all sorts of tribulations, masses and sermons, fasts and prayers, it would be to fear all sorts of loves, whatever they may be, because of the dangers that may be found in them, it would be to supremely desire paradise and to fear hell, to refuse all sorts of honors, temporal things and everything that brings ease, by taking away from Nature what she asks, except only what she could not live without, following the example of the suffering and passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ. This is what I can say and advise best to all those who live under my obedience. And for all that, I say to everyone that no one will understand this book by my way of understanding, but it must be understood by the virtue of Faith and by the strength of Love who are my masters, for I obey them completely. I would even say more: whoever has these two strings to his bow — namely the light of Faith and the strength of Love —, has the permission to do whatever he pleases, according to the testimony of Love himself who says to the soul: "Beloved, love and do what you will[^1]!"
**Love:**
Reason, you are very wise and very sure of what belongs to you, in wanting to have an answer to the above words. But since you have asked me to explain to you what this means, I will answer all your questions. I assure you, Reason: these souls governed by Perfect Love, consider shame as much as honor and honor as much as shame, poverty as much as wealth and wealth as much as poverty, the torments of God and his creatures as much as the comfort of God and his creatures, being loved as much as being hated and being hated as much as being loved, being in hell as much as being in paradise and being in paradise as much as being in hell, a modest condition as much as a more advantageous one and a more advantageous one as much as one that depends on it. Truth knows this well, and she also knows that they neither want nor do not want any of these prosperities or adversities, for these souls have no other will than what God wants in them, and the divine will does not burden these exceptional creatures with the troubles we have just spoken of. I have just said that these souls consider all the adversities of the heart — for the body as for the soul — as much as prosperity, and prosperity: why does this book say that this soul possesses everything and yet possesses nothing[^2]? as adversity: this is true if they come to them without their will being the cause; also these souls do not know what is best for them, nor in what way God wants to procure their salvation or that of their neighbor, nor on what occasion God wants to do justice or mercy, nor on what occasion God wants to give the soul the exceptional gifts he makes in the goodness of his divine nobility. And that is why the liberated soul has no will to want or not to want, but only to want the will of God and to endure in peace the divine dispositions.
**Reason:**
Sire Love, I add one more thing to my question the truth, for this soul possesses God by divine grace, and whoever possesses God possesses everything; and yet, it says that it possesses nothing, because everything that this soul possesses in her of God by the gift of divine grace seems nothing to her: this is worth compared to what she loves and which is in Him, and this, he will give to no one else but Himself. And according to this way of understanding, this soul possesses everything and yet possesses nothing, she knows everything and yet knows nothing.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 14. Comment cette âme connaît Dieu par la foi 1

**Love:** This soul knows, by the virtue of faith, that God is all-powerful, that He is all wisdom and perfect goodness, and that God the Father has effected the incarnation, as well as the Son and the Holy Spirit. She also knows that God the Father has united human nature to the person of God the Son, and that God the Son has united it to His own person, and that the Holy Spirit has united it to the person of God the Son, so well that the Father possesses in Him a single nature, namely the divine nature, that the person of the Son possesses in Him three natures, namely the same nature as that of the Father, the nature of the soul and the nature of the body, while being a single person in the Trinity, and that the Holy Spirit possesses in Him this same divine nature that the Father and the Son possess. To believe, say, think this, that is true contemplation: a single power, a single knowledge, a single will, a single God in three persons and three persons in a single God. This God is everywhere according to His divine nature, but His humanity is only in paradise in glory, united to the person of the Son, as well as to the sacrament of the altar.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 15. Où l’on parle du Saint-Sacrement de l’autel1

**Love:** This divinity and this humanity, Christians receive it when they approach the Holy Sacrament of the altar. To what extent this humanity remains in them, faith teaches and the clerics know.

**Light of Faith:** And that is why we will make an assumption to better understand this sacrament. Take this sacrament, put it in a mortar with something else and grind it until you can neither see nor feel the person you have placed in it.

**Faith:** Truly, I tell you that it is no longer there. You may then ask: "Has it therefore departed?"

**Truth:** No. It was there, but now it is no longer there (understand this correctly, and not in a human way). You may then ask if it has returned as it came, but I tell you that the humanity of Jesus Christ does not come and go.

**Temptation:** What can it be then?

**Truth:** It was there when it could be seen and felt; but now, it is no longer there since it can neither be seen nor felt: thus has divine power disposed. And this very humanity which is in the sacrament of the altar, is not seen under another appearance; and neither the angels, nor the saints, nor the Virgin Mary see it otherwise than we see it ourselves, and if they see it under the appearance in which we see it, it is through spiritual understanding, for to see the glorified humanity of Jesus Christ in the sacrament of the altar does not belong to the state of those who are in glory. And that is why they do not see it glorified there, except through understanding.

**The soul whose faith is illuminated by the divine Trinity:** And we, we see it there by the virtue of faith, rejecting reasoning according to our senses which see there only bread, nor feel nor taste anything else, nor receive its smell. But our faith rejects them all, for it firmly believes without doubting that there is neither whiteness, nor smell, nor taste, but that it is the precious body of Jesus Christ, true God and true man. We, we see it there by faith, which those who are in glory do not do — for what is in glory does not exercise faith —, and that is why they do not see it as we see it. And the divine Trinity has disposed the Holy Sacrament of the altar in this state to feed, nourish, and sustain Holy Church. Such is the disposition of the sacrament of the altar by divine power, according to the knowledge of God and according to what I believe.

**Courtesy of the Goodness of Love:** Do not marvel if we tell you these things out of love, for I can well tell you without incurring reproaches, that no one can succeed in a deep foundation nor a high edifice without putting into it the subtlety of great natural wisdom and the finesse of the light of spiritual understanding. And for that, one cannot know too much in seeking the divine will. Indeed, the understanding that gives light shows by its nature to the soul what it loves; and the soul receiving the closeness and union through the light of understanding, and the state to which it tends to find its foundation and rest through the concord of a union in abundant love, willingly listens to the knowledge and light that bring it news of its love; indeed, it comes from Love, and that is why it wants to be returned there to have only one will in love: the single will of the one it loves.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 16. Où Amour répond à Raison sur ce qu’il a dit que l'âme sait tout

and knows nothing
Love: Reason, regarding what I said that the liberated soul knows everything and yet knows
nothing[^1], I answer you that it knows by the virtue of faith what it needs to know for
its salvation; and yet it knows nothing of what God possesses in it, of himself
and for it[^2], and which he will give to no one else but it. And
thus, in this way of understanding, this soul knows everything and yet knows
nothing.
It wants everything, and yet it wants nothing: indeed, this soul wants so
perfectly the will of God, that it neither knows, nor can, nor wants anything
else in its will but the will of God, so much has Love put it in a strong prison;
and yet, it wants nothing, for what it wants and what God wants in it is so
little compared to what it would want to want, that it cannot have what
God wants it to want. Indeed, its will is nothing compared to the one that
would satisfy it and which will never be given to it: this is the will of the will of
God, as has already been said[^3]. And thus, in this way of understanding, this
soul wants everything and yet wants nothing.
This daughter of Zion[^4] neither desires masses nor sermons, neither fasts nor prayers.
Reason: And why, sire Love? Yet it is the nourishment of holy souls!
Love: It is true for those who beg, but this one begs for nothing, for
it has no need to desire anything that is outside of it. Now,
Reason, understand: why would this soul desire the things I have just
named, since God is just as well everywhere without them as with them? This soul
has no other thought, word, or deed, but the exercise of the grace of the divine Trinity.
It feels no sorrow for the sins it ever committed, nor for
the sufferings of God for it, nor for the sins or for the evils
in which its neighbor remains.
Reason: God! But what does this mean, Love?
Teach me the way to understand it, since you have appeased me on my
other questions.
Love: It means that this soul does not belong to itself, so much so that it cannot
feel sorrow, for its thought is established in a peaceful place, and it is in the
Trinity; it cannot move from it nor feel sorrow as long as
its Beloved is well. But should someone fall into sin, and that
sin was ever committed, this displeases its will as it does God's, for it is its very displeasure that gives this soul this displeasure.
Nevertheless, the Trinity feels no sorrow in it for this displeasure, so much
so that this soul established in it feels none either. Certainly, if this soul
established so high could help its neighbor, it would help with all its power in
what it needs; but the thoughts of such souls are so divine, that they do not
linger so much in transient and created things that they conceive
sorrow for them, since God is good without measure[^5].

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 17. Où Amour répond à Raison

on what he said that these souls give to Nature what she demands[^1]
**Love:** This soul gives to Nature as much as she demands; it is true that
this soul does not put so much care or love into temporal things that she
could gain by refusing them to her; she would rather scruple to take away from her what
belongs to her. However, these creatures are so excellent that one does not dare to
speak of them openly, especially of their exercise; through it, these souls are able
to understand as they should, but few are those who taste this way of
understanding.
I just said that one does not dare to speak of them openly: certainly, it should not
be done, because of the simplistic way of understanding of other creatures, for fear
that by misunderstanding, they might receive harm from it.
The souls such as those this book speaks of, in touching something of their
exercise, are in such a condition, in the straight line of their state, a pure and
divine state, that if they had nothing, even being certain of having to live until
judgment, they could not take to heart for a single moment anything that
they lack, for all the gold in the world, except only to the extent that Nature
needs what she requires and to give her what belongs to her. And if such
souls had something — few people know where they are, but there must
be some by the just goodness of Love, to sustain the faith of Holy Church —,
if they had something knowing that others need it more
than they do, they would not retain it in any case, even if they were then certain that
the earth would never again bear bread, wheat, or other sustenance. And this is
the truth, let no one doubt it!
Such is its nature by pure justice,
And this justice is divine justice,
Which has given its measure to this soul.
**Divine Justice:** It is just. All justice must be accomplished in them. And if
they retained what is necessary for their neighbor, they would retain what
does not belong to them according to the perfection of the peace of charity in which they live
totally, for it is the nourishment that is proper to them. But on the other hand,
why would these souls scruple to take what they need when
necessity demands it? It would be for them a lack of innocence and an
obstacle to the peace in which the soul rests from all things. Who then should
scruple to take what he needs from the four elements[^2] which
are the clarity of the sky, the heat of the fire, the dew of the water, and the earth that
supports us? We use these four elements in all ways that
Nature needs, without reproach from Reason. These gracious elements are made by
God like the rest. Thus these souls use everything that is made and created and
that Nature needs, in perfect peace of heart, as they do with the earth
on which they walk.
**Love:** They have a solid foundation and a lofty edifice, which keeps them at rest
from all things[^3].

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 18. Comment ces créatures ne peuvent plus parler de Dieu

**Soul:** These creatures can no longer speak of God, for, no more than they can say where God is, they can say who God is. Indeed, whoever speaks of God when he wants, to whom he wants, and where he wants to speak, must know without any doubt that he has never felt the true heart of divine love, for this seizes the soul in the midst of all without her noticing it. Indeed, the true and refined heart of divine love is without the matter of creature, and it is given from creator to creature; and these souls are accustomed to understand much and to forget everything because of the subtlety of their lover.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 19. Comment Foi, Espérance et Charité demandent à Amour la

knowledge of these souls
Faith, Hope, and Charity: O Holy Trinity, where are the exceptional souls such as those mentioned in this book? Who are they? And where are they? And what do they do? Show them to us, by Love who knows all, and those who are moved by listening to this book will be soothed! Indeed, the entire Holy Church would marvel if it heard it read!
Faith: It is true.
Love: It is true of Holy Church the Lesser! The Church that is governed by Reason; but not of Holy Church the Greater, which is governed by us!
Love, to the three theological Virtues: But then, why do you ask us who they are, and where they are, and what they do? Surely, if you do not know, nothing that God has created could find them! But where they are, you all three know, for you are with them at all times, since it is you three who make them noble. And what they do, you know as well.
However, who they are — if we speak of their worth and dignity — neither you nor they know, so much so that Holy Church cannot know.
Reason: In the name of God, who then knows?
Love: Only He who created and redeemed them, and perhaps recreated them many times, for the sole love of whom they are exiled, annihilated, and forgotten.
How then does Holy Church marvel that the Virtues serve these high celestial souls? Why would they not? Are not the Virtues all praised, prescribed, and ordained for these souls, and not these souls for the Virtues? So much so that these Virtues are made to serve these souls, while these souls are made to obey God and to receive the singular gifts of the pure courtesy of His divine nobility, gifts that God does not bestow on any creature dwelling in desire and will. Thus, whoever wishes to possess these gifts must not be accompanied by either desire or will, for otherwise, he will not possess them.
And why would Holy Church know these queens, daughters, sisters, and wives of the king? For Holy Church to know them perfectly would mean that it would be within their soul; but no created thing enters there, except only He who created them, so much so that no one knows these souls, except God who is within them.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 20. Amour répond à Raison sur ce qu'il a dit que personne ne

knows these souls, except God
**Reason:** Yes, Love, but with all due respect, I must ask another
question, and I would be surprised if you did not answer it.
**Love, to Reason:** Very well. Tell me, what is your question?
**Reason:** I will tell you. This book declares that no one knows these souls,
except God who is in them. However, it has previously said that no one can
find or know them, except the one who pursues True Love, but that
whoever finds them would speak the truth about them; this is what this book said earlier [^1].
From which it seems that those who are such know those who are also,
provided they have been where they are [^2].
**Love:** That is true, for those who are such, provided they have been where
they are, would know their companions by their practice [^3], but even more
by the strength of the gift that is given to them and which is unique.
**Reason:** Unique! and how so! for in hearing it, I am singularly
astonished.
**Love:** Reason, the same word can be understood in two ways. Indeed, if
those who are such know the practice of these souls, and that is the most perfect state
that God gives to a creature, they still do not know their
dignity, for God alone knows it, He who created them.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 21. Amour répond au blâme de Raison, à propos de ce que ce livre

**Reason:** Now, Love, I pose you another question. Indeed, this book says that this soul takes leave of the Virtues in all that it does, whereas you say that the Virtues are always with these souls, more perfectly than with any other: these seem to me to be two opposing statements; I cannot understand them.

**Love:** I will appease you. It is true that this soul has taken leave of the Virtues in terms of their exercise and the desire for what they demand; but the Virtues have not taken leave of her, for they are always with her, and that, by obeying her perfectly. And in this way of understanding, this soul takes leave of them, and yet they are always with her.

Indeed, if a man serves a master, he belongs to the one he serves, but his master does not belong to him; however, it sometimes happens that this servant gains and learns so much with his master, that he becomes richer and wiser than him, so much so that he leaves him to find a better one. And when the one who was his master sees that the one who was his servant is certainly worth more and knows more than him, he stays with him to obey him in all things. It is exactly in this way that you can and should understand what is said about the Virtues and these souls. Indeed, at the beginning, whatever it cost her in heart and body, this soul did everything that Reason taught her, who was her mistress, and Reason always told her to do everything that the Virtues wanted, without contradicting and until death, so much so that Reason and the other Virtues were mistresses of this soul, and this soul was truly obedient to everything they wanted to command because she wanted to live a spiritual life. Now, it is so that this soul has gained and learned so much with the Virtues, that she is now above them; indeed, she has in herself everything that the Virtues can teach, and even more, without comparison, for this soul possesses in herself the master of the Virtues, who is called divine Love, who has totally transformed her into him and united her to him, so much so that she no longer belongs to herself nor to the Virtues.

**Reason:** And to whom does she belong then?

**Love:** To my will, which has transformed her into me.

**Reason:** But who are you, Love? Are you not one of the Virtues along with us, even admitting that you are above us?

**Love:** I am God, for Love is God and God is Love, and this soul is God by condition of love; I am God by divine nature, and this soul is by justice of love, so much so that my tender and beloved is taught and guided by me without herself, for she is transformed into me.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 22. Comment cette âme est comparée à l’aigle, et comment elle

takes leave of Nature
**Love:** This soul is compared to the eagle because it flies high, very high, even higher than any bird, for it is feathered with True Love. It looks in all its clarity at the beauty of the sun, its ray, and their splendor which gives it as nourishment the marrow of the high cedar[^1].
**The soul, to the unfortunate Nature who has made it remain many days in servitude:** Lady Nature, I take leave of you: Love is near me, I hold myself in Freedom thanks to him, without fear and before all.
**Love:** This soul is not frightened by tribulation, nor does it stop at consolation, nor is it grieved by temptation, nor is it diminished by any subtraction. It is common to all in the largesse of pure charity; thus it asks nothing of anyone, because of the noble courtesy of the pure goodness with which God has filled it. It is at all times serious without sadness and joyful without dissolution, for in it, God has sanctified his name, and the divine Trinity holds its house there.
You others, the little ones, you who find your nourishment in will and desire, desire to be such, for he who can desire the least and does not desire the most, is not worthy that God should give him the least of his goods, because of the cowardice to which he lets himself go in his poor courage, so that he is always seen hungry.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 23. Comment cette âme a deux piliers, et comment elle est ivre de

what she never drinks
**Love:**
This liberated soul leans on two pillars, one to the right, the other to the left. Thanks to these two pillars, the soul is strong against its enemies, like a castle on a mound surrounded by the sea, impossible to undermine. One of these pillars, which keeps the soul strong against its enemies and preserves the gifts that make it rich, is the true knowledge it has of its own poverty. The left pillar, on which it leans at all times, is strength, and the right one is the elevated knowledge it receives from pure Divinity.
The soul is supported by these two pillars, so well that it does not guard against its enemies, neither to the right nor to the left; indeed, it is so seized by the knowledge of its poverty that it seems completely astonished in the eyes of the world as well as in its own. And it is so intoxicated by the knowledge of the love and grace of pure Divinity, that it is always drunk with knowledge and filled with the praises of divine love; and not only drunk with what it has drunk, but entirely drunk and more than drunk with what it has never drunk nor ever will drink.
**Reason:**
In the name of God, Love, what does it mean that this soul is drunk with what it has never drunk nor ever will drink? It seems, from what I can understand of these words, that there is more to intoxicate this soul in what its beloved drinks, has drunk, or will drink of the divine beverage of his own goodness, than in what it itself has drunk or will drink from the same barrel.
**Love:**
That is correct. It is what surpasses it that makes it drunk, but without it having drunk any, as it is said; and yet, yes! it has drunk because its beloved has drunk, for between him and it, by the transformation of love, there is no difference, regardless of their natures. Love operates in it by justice this transformation which has intoxicated it with what, in its drink, surpasses it, and it will never be otherwise.
It happens that there are several taps on a barrel, but the clearest, newest, most beneficial, most delightful, and most intoxicating wine is the wine from the top tap, it is the sovereign drink that no one drinks, except the Trinity. And from this drink, without drinking it, the annihilated soul, the liberated soul, the forgotten soul is drunk, entirely drunk and more than drunk, though it has never drunk nor ever will drink.
Now, listen and understand, if you want further explanation. In this barrel of divine beverage, there are certainly several taps: the humanity united to the person of the Son of God knows this, it who, after the Trinity, drinks from the noblest; the Virgin Mary drinks from the next, and this noble lady is drunk from the highest; and after her, it is the ardent Seraphim who drink, on whose wings these free souls fly.
**Holy Church:**
My God! How purely must one love, and with how much refinement must one care for a soul that flies so high!
**Love:**
This soul is an abyss by the humility of its memory, its understanding, and its will, and its knowledge is very piercing by its subtlety, and it is everywhere very free by the love of Divinity.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 24. En quel temps ces âmes sont en la droite liberté de Pur Amour

**Reason:** Well then, Love, when are these souls in the true freedom of Pure Love?

**Love:** When they have no desire, nor feel in any way, nor the slightest affection of spirit at any moment; indeed, such an exercise would enslave them, because it is too far from the peace of freedom, to which few people abandon themselves. Also, they do nothing that is against the peace of their inner state, and thus they bear in peace the dispositions of Love.

The people who live this are in such fullness, that they have the divine sun within them, without begging outside, and thereby they can keep the purity of the heart; and no one else but them has knowledge of what surpasses them; and if they did not have knowledge of it, they could beg from what does not surpass them, but they could not be satisfied thus.

These souls are alone in all things and common[^1] in all things, for they do not lose the freedom of their state, whatever happens to them. Indeed, just as the sun receives the clarity of God[^2] and shines on all things without contracting any impurity, likewise these souls receive their state from God and in God without contracting impurity, whatever they see or hear outside themselves.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 25. Raison demande à Amour si ces âmes sentent quelque joie en

**Reason:** But tell me, Love: do these souls feel any joy within themselves or outside of themselves?

**Love:** I answer no to your question; indeed, their nature is killed and their spirit is dead, for all will has separated from them, and that is why it lives, it remains, and it is in the divine will, due to this killing. Now, Reason, listen, to better understand what you have asked! He who burns is not cold, and he who drowns is not thirsty. Now this soul is so burning in the furnace of the fire of love, that it has become fire, properly speaking, so much so that it does not feel the fire, since it is fire in itself by the force of Love which has transformed it into the fire of love. This fire goes out of itself and burns by itself in all places and at all times without consuming any matter, nor being able to want to consume anything other than what comes from itself. Indeed, whoever feels God through a matter that he sees or hears outside of himself or by his own effort, that one is not entirely fire, but rather there is matter mixed with this fire: the effort of man, the fact of wanting to have matter outside of oneself so that the love of God may grow within oneself, this is but a blindness to the knowledge of the goodness of God; whereas he who burns with this fire without seeking matter, without having it and without wanting to have it, that one sees so clearly in all things, that he appreciates them at their true value. Indeed, this soul has no matter within it that would prevent it from seeing clearly, since it is alone in itself by the virtue of true humility, that it is common to all by the largesse of perfect charity, and alone in God by the divine enterprise of *Fin Amour*[^1].

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 26. Comment cette âme n’aime rien, sinon pour l’amour de Dieu

**Love:** This soul neither loves nor will love anything in God, however noble it may be, except solely for God and because He wills it; thus she will love God in all things and things for the love of Him; and through this love, this soul is solely in the pure love of the love of God. Her knowledge is so clear that she sees herself as nothingness in God, and sees God as nothingness in her. Now, noble lovers, understand what remains to be understood through meditation of love, without listening to it from a creature, for this meditation that the soul borrows from Love — without desiring any of its gifts that are called consolations and which comfort the soul by making it feel the sweetness of prayer — teaches it, and no other exercise does, but pure love. Indeed, he who would desire the comforts of God by feeling some consolation would hinder the enterprise of Perfect Love.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 27. Comment Méditation-d’Amour-Pur n’a qu’une seule intention

**Love:** Meditation-on-Pure-Love has but one intention, which is to love always loyally without wanting to receive any reward; and this, the soul can only do without itself[^1], for Loyal Love would not deign to receive any consolation that would come from the acquisition it would make, that is quite certain.
Meditation-on-Love knows well that the best is to dispense with nothing other than its own work, and to perfectly will the will of God; and it lets God work and dispose of His will, for he whose will is that the will of God be done in making him feel His comforts, that one would not trust perfectly in His sole goodness, but in the gifts of the riches He can give.
**Soul:** And certainly, he who would love well, would remember neither to take nor to ask, but would rather always want to give without retaining anything in order to love loyally, for he who would have two intentions in a single operation, one would weaken the other. And that is why Loyal Love has but one intention, and it is to always be able to love loyally, for it does not doubt at all that its lover would do for the best in his love, provided that he does what he must do; thus it wants nothing, except that the will of God be done in him.
**Love:** He is right, for everything is there; thus this soul can want nothing of its own power, for its will is not its own nor in it, but it is rather in the one who loves it; and it is not its operation, but rather that of the entire Trinity which operates in this soul according to its will.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 28. Comment cette âme nage en l’océan de Joie

**Love:** This soul swims in the ocean of Joy, that is to say in the ocean of delights
that flow and stream from the Divinity, and thus feels no joy,
for it is joy itself, and thus swims and flows in joy without
feeling any joy, for it dwells in Joy and Joy dwells in it: it is joy
itself by the force of Joy which has transformed it into itself. There is now a
common will to the lover and the beloved: they are like fire and flame, for
Love has transformed this soul into himself.

**The soul:** Yes, very sweet pure and divine Love, what a sweet transformation it is
to be transformed into what I love more than myself! And I am so
transformed that I have lost my name to love, I who can love so little:
it is in Love that I am transformed, for I love no one else
but Love.

pure freedom of Love

**Reason:** Now, sire Love, I would ask you to explain what you mean by declaring that this soul is in the true freedom of Pure Love, when it does nothing that is opposed to the peace that its inner state demands.

**Love:** I will explain what that means: it is that it does nothing, whatever happens, that is against the perfect peace of its mind. Thus does the true innocent, and the state we speak of is true innocence.

Reason, I give you an example: look at a child — who is a pure innocent —; does he do or stop doing something, little or much, if it does not please him?

**Reason:** No, certainly, Love, I can well understand that; and thereby, I am satisfied with this question.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 30. Comment Raison demande à Amour de satisfaire cette âme en

saying of God all that he could say and declare about Him
**Reason:** Well then! Lord Love, I beg you, please satisfy this soul by
saying at least all that can be said of Him who is entirely in all
things.
**Love:** She knows this, for she always finds Him there, that is to say, in all
things; indeed, one must seek a thing where it is, and since He is everywhere,
this soul finds Him everywhere. And moreover, all things suit her, for she
finds nothing anywhere without finding God there. Now, why
do you want me to satisfy this soul by saying of God all that can be
said about Him?
**Reason:** It is so that she may rest peacefully in her state of innocence, without
having any reason to stir or move to hear talk of you.
**Love, to Reason:** I will tell you willingly. I assure you, Reason, and
I guarantee it on myself: all that this soul has heard about God and
all that can be said about Him is nothing, strictly speaking, compared to what
He is in Himself — and this has never been nor will ever be said —, rather than all that
has been said about Him has ever been, and one could cease speaking of Him[^1]. (And
yet, Love continues to speak to the soul to increase her joy and her pain,
and to satisfy her in all her endeavors:) Soul, Madam, I declare
this to you once and for all — and please do not ask me for more, for it
would be a wasted effort —: all creatures, without exception, who remain and
will remain in the vision of the sweet face of your spouse, have grasped less and
will grasp less of Him, compared to His dignity or what there would be to know,
to love, to praise about Him and what He Himself knows, rather than one could truly
say that one knows, loves, or praises anything about Him.
**The Soul:** Alas, alas! Love, what shall I do then? Truly, I have never believed
anything better than what you are telling me now, but, Lord Love, there is one thing
I would tell you, if I could.
**Love:** So be it! dear soul, say what you please, I am willing to listen.
**The Soul, astonished:** Well then! dearest Love, tell me, in the name of God:
why did He take such care to create me, to redeem me, and to recreate me if it is
to give me so little, He who has so much to give? To be honest, one does not dare speak
of what He wants to do... I really do not know, but if it were so that I
could give something, I would not give Him such a small share, I who am nothing while He is
everything; indeed, if I had something to give, I could not keep anything for myself and not give it all to Him. Besides, of the little that I have, I have kept nothing for myself, neither my body, nor my heart,
nor my soul, and He knows it well! And now that I have given Him everything, I who have
nothing to give, it is very clear that I would give Him everything I had, if I had
something to give! Yet, He has taken everything I had, He has given me nothing,
and He has kept everything; in the name of God, Love, tell me a little! is this a
share worthy of a beloved?
**Love:** Well then! dear soul, you know more than you say. If you have given Him
everything, it is the best thing that could happen to you! And yet you give
Him nothing that was not His before you gave it to Him. So, see: what
are you doing for Him then?
**The Soul:** You speak the truth, dear Love; I can neither deny it nor do I want to...

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 31. Comment Amour calme l’âme parce qu’elle a donné à son

she gave her husband everything she had
**Love:** Well then! Dearest soul, what do you want him to give you? Besides,
aren't you a creature? Would you want to receive from your beloved something that it is neither fitting for him to give, nor for you to receive? Calm yourself, dear soul, if you believe me, for he gives a creature nothing other than what you have, and this gift, he gives as it suits you.
**The soul:** Yes, Lord Love, but you did not speak to me like that the day I made your acquaintance! Indeed, you told me that between beloved and lover, there was no lordship; whereas there is, it seems to me, since one has everything and the other has nothing beside that everything! But if I could arrange it, I would, for if I could as much as you can, I would love you as much as you are worth.
**Love:** Look! Dearest soul, you can no longer speak! Calm yourself! Your will is enough for your beloved. He orders you through me to trust him, and he orders me to tell you that he will love nothing without you, nor will you love anything without him. It is a very beautiful privilege, and let that suffice for you, dear soul, if you believe me.
**The soul:** In the name of God, Lord Love, be silent! For on this matter I certainly could not, myself, be silent, even if the whole world were to be saved; indeed, I have nothing that I love more strongly than what suffices me, for if what I love did not suffice me, I would fall into decline and decay, as much as I have little love. And yet, Lord Love, one thing alone suffices me, and I will tell you, it is that the one I love more than myself — and I love nothing else except for him — has within him what you told me no one knows except himself. And so, since I love him more than myself and he is the sum of all goods, my lord, my God, and my all, he is all my comfort. And thus, if I am desolate for what I lack, I am nonetheless comforted by the fact that he lacks nothing, for he has within him the abundance of all goods, without any lack; and that is all my peace and the true rest of my mind, for I love only for him. And so, since I love only for him, I lack nothing, whatever I may have said before: it is certain, for those who understand well, and what I wanted was to speak of him, since no one spoke to me about him when I would have gladly heard about him. But Lord Love has told me the truth: it is that on this matter, I calm myself, since the best that could be said to me is nothing compared to what is in him. And I did not need to hear more about him than what was said to me, namely that my beloved cannot be grasped. And it is true, for one could not even grasp the smallest thing that is comparable to him, so much so that my love, however great it may be, would not have found an end to its love in always receiving new love from the one who is all love.
That is all that can be said to me, and nothing would have appeased me, except what Love has said about himself. That is why I say to all that all my questions come down to the fact that nothing can be said to me about him; and such is the beloved of my soul.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 32. Comment Amour fait durer ces âmes en leur sens

**Discernment:** In the name of God, think a little! How can these souls endure in their sense?

**The soul:** I know it well! Love makes them endure there! He is master in this work! I just said that nothing is lacking to me since my beloved is self-sufficient by his just nobility, without beginning or end. I do not love myself, and I love him and his works only for him alone; thus what he has, and which I neither have nor will ever have, is better for me than what I have and will have in my possession through him.

**Reason:** Prove it then!

**The soul:** It is easy to prove; here is the proof: I love a hundred thousand times more the abundance of goods that remain in him, than the gifts that I receive and will receive from him in possession. And because I love more what is in him beyond my understanding, than what is in him and within my understanding, what he knows and that I do not know is better for me than what I know of him and which is mine, for where there is what surpasses me in my love, there is what surpasses me in my treasure. And because I love more what in him surpasses me and that I will never know, than what does not surpass me and that I will know of him, what I love more is mine, by reason of what surpasses me in my love[^1], according to the testimony of Love himself. Such is the fulfillment of my love according to the spirit[^2].

And for that reason, Lord Love, I want to say this again: if it were possible that one of his creatures received from him the power and the will to give me joy and glory, that she received it alone as much as all those who are at his court, but without him giving it to me personally, I would refuse it now and forever rather than accept it or want to accept it from anyone other than him: no, truly! Rather eternal death! Besides, I could not, since he has so bound me to him, that I can want nothing without him.

Dear Love, in the name of God, support me, for I am wholly seized because of my beloved, so much that I do not know what to ask. And what would I ask about him? I know truly that, no more than one could count the waves of the sea in a great wind, no one can describe or say what the spirit grasps, however little and slightly it grasps something of God; and that is no wonder, for the body is too coarse to speak of the grasps of the spirit. And yet, it is commonly said that something bitter is better than nothing at all: so I tell you likewise that it is better to hear what is described and said about it, than to hear nothing about it.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 33. L’âme s’étonne lorsqu’elle pense aux dons de la bonté de Dieu

**Soul [to God1]:** But how, Lord, have I remained in my right mind when I thought of the gifts of your goodness, since you have given my soul the vision of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and that it will have it without end? Since I will see something as great as the Trinity, the knowledge of the angels, souls, and saints will not be taken from me, nor the vision of the small things, that is, of all things lesser than God! Yes, Lord, what have you done for me there? Truly, I am entirely seized by what I know of it, to the point that I do not know what to marvel at, and that I have no other exercise nor can have any other as long as this knowledge lasts. If only, Lord, I had no other occasion to marvel than this one: you have given my soul the vision of the entire Trinity, of the angels and souls—something you have not given to your precious body, united to the nature of the Father in the person of the Son, so much so that I marvel at being able to live still—...; but there is more, Lord: while it is already such a great thing to see the angels and souls to whom you have given the vision of your sweet face, while these angels and souls, no body is capable of seeing them, and even less can any body see the Trinity since it cannot see either the angels or the souls, nevertheless, you have given this to my spirit, forever and for as long as you will be God.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 34. Comment l’âme dit qu’elle ne peut rien d’elle-même

**Soul:** In the name of God, Love, I beg you to tell me what I should do, I who know this and who know the gifts of the goodness of my beloved.
**Love:** I will tell you, but do not ask me for more. And the best I can tell you is that if you perfectly know your nothingness, you will do nothing, and this nothingness will give you everything. But if you cannot come to perfectly know your nothingness — which, in truth, is all that is proper to you — then you must do something, and as best as you can, otherwise you would fall back from what you have conceived in your mind. If God has transformed you into him, you must not forget your nothingness, that is to say, you must not forget who you were when he created you in the beginning, and what you would be if he had considered your works, and who you are and would be if there were not in you what is of him.
**Soul [to God]:** Yes, Lord, I am certain that I have nothing of my own except my horrible faults, for which you suffered death to give me life. But there is more, Lord: according to what I understand and hope — and in truth it is so — if no one else but me alone had sinned, you would still have redeemed my soul turned away from your love, by dying naked on the cross for me and exercising your power ordained to destroy sin. Thus, Lord, all that you have suffered in your sweet humanity, you have suffered for me, as if no one else had sinned, but me alone, so that I owe this to you alone. And I owe you even more: indeed, in addition to what I do not have of my own, I owe you all the difference there is from you to me for whom you gave yourself. In any case, Lord, you know that I can do nothing, while you have thus indebted me to you; but I beg you, dear and beloved, to acquit me of this debt by your courtesy, you who have the power to do everything. And, certainly, Lord, you will do it, provided that I henceforth desire in all things your perfect will.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 35. Comment cette âme blâme Raison, et dit qu’elle est aimée de

God without beginning
**Soul:**
Now, dearest Love, I beg you: show me how my operation is the very same as that of the Trinity.
**Love:**
Tell me then your thought, for you must not hide it from me.
**Soul:**
Lord Love, I will tell you. You have told me that he who is in himself by himself without beginning, will never love anything without me, nor I without him.
**Love:**
It is true, I assure you.
**Soul:**
Since he will never love — in other words: without end — anything without me, it follows that he never loved anything without me. Indeed, since he will be without end in me by love, I have therefore also been loved by him without beginning.
**Reason:**
Be careful what you say, Madam! Have you forgotten that it was not long ago that you were created, and that you were not? In the name of God, dearest soul, be careful not to fall into error!
**Soul:**
If I am wrong in holding this opinion, lady Reason, Love is wrong with me, he who makes me believe, think, and say this.
**Reason:**
Prove then what you say, Madam!
**Soul:**
But how tiresome you are, Reason! What trouble and pain for those who live under your counsel! Reason, if I am loved without end by the three persons of the Trinity, I have also been loved by them without beginning: just as God will love me without end by his goodness, I have likewise been in the knowledge of his Wisdom when it established that I would be created by the operation of his divine power. Thus, since I have been in divine knowledge since God is, he who is without beginning, and that I will be there without end, it follows that he always loved by his goodness the operation he was going to do in me by his divine power.
**Love:**
It is true; from always, he would never have wanted to refrain from loving you, no more than he does now.
**Soul:**
There you go! Reason, you have therefore heard the testimony of Love; be silent henceforth, and cease meddling in my affairs!
**Reason:**
Yes, Madam, since Love governs you and you do not govern Love; in other words, since Love dwells in you and makes of you his will without yourself, I will no longer dare to meddle with you nor intervene. On the contrary, Madam, I promise you henceforth obedience and peace with all my power; indeed, I am forced to act thus, and since Love wills it, I cannot go against it, but rather I yield to you completely.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 36. Comment l’âme est libre et n’est plus soumise à Raison

**The soul, to Reason:** Henceforth, the debts are indeed reversed, and rightly so,
for the noble courtesy of my spouse would no longer deign to leave me in
your servitude nor in that of another; for it is also necessary that the spouse frees
the wife he has taken freely.
**Love:** It is true, dearest soul, I grant it and confess it.
**Reason:** In the name of God, Madam, think, say, and do whatever you
wish, since Love desires and grants it!
**The soul, to Reason:** Reason, how harsh you are! Love desires and grants me to
say, think, and do whatever I wish: and why not? It is he who does it himself, for by myself, I can do nothing if my beloved does not do it
himself in me. And you marvel that he desires what I desire?
But, at every turn, he must desire it, for I desire nothing other than what he
desires in me and what he desires me to desire; by his courtesy, he has established me in such
a way that he desires what I desire, and he desires nothing that I do not desire. And I am at
peace, Reason, because we have, he and I, this concord.
**[To God]:** Yes, dearest master of this work, how can I have this peace,
when I know I have thus lost my own operation? And yet, Lord,
I can indeed! For your courtesy and your nobility desire that I too be
at peace, since you are. So much so, Lord, that I see clearly that
you have well discharged this debt — which was to give me peace —,
for whatever I find, whatever happens or has happened to my sins,
your peace always remains with me.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 37. Où l’âme dit qu’au paradis, ses péchés seront connus pour sa

greater glory
**Soul [to God]:** Lord, no one but you can know in this world my sins in all their ugliness and hideousness; but in paradise, Lord, all those who are there will know them, not to my confusion, but to my very great glory, for in seeing that I have angered you with my sins, your mercy, Lord, will be known, as well as your generosity full of courtesy.
**Love [to God]:** This courtesy gives peace of conscience to this soul, whatever she does or does not do, because she desires your will; for to perfectly desire your will is perfect charity, and whoever always has perfect charity in their will, will never have remorse or reproach of conscience. Indeed, remorse or reproach of conscience in the soul is nothing other than a lack of charity, for the soul is created for nothing other than to have in it endlessly the state of pure charity.
**Soul [to God]:** Yes, Lord, what have I said about you!
**Love:** Think about it, and see if you can recognize your words.
**Soul:** Yes, sire Love, you have given me the knowledge, you understand it now. The work is nothing when it must be nothing; therefore I must be certain that what I have said is less than nothing. But what is in me or through me and which is of divine knowledge, it is you yourself, sire Love, who have said it in me and through me in your goodness, for my benefit and that of others; and therefore, if it does not stop with the listeners or readers of this book[^1], the glory will be yours and the benefit ours.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 38. Comment l’âme reconnaît la courtoisie d’Amour en

perfectly recognizing her poverty
**Soul [to God]:** O beloved! whom I have abandoned and from whom I have turned away!
you are to me courteous beyond measure, as it must well seem to me when you wish to suffer — suffer, Lord? and still you wish it more willingly than anyone can say! — that I remain in my desert, that is to say in this wretched body, without limit of time! However, for whatever mercy there is in you, I cannot recover the loss of past time, for it is necessary, dear and beloved, to keep your justice; and therefore, it cannot be that the lost time is ever returned to me, nor that I am so far from loving you, knowing you, and praising you.
**[To Love:**] Ah! how many moments of idleness! How many faults into which I have fallen, I who am the abyss of all poverty! And yet, in this abyss of poverty, you wish to place, if it does not depend on myself, the gift of grace of which you have just spoken. Spoken? Truly, sire Love, everything you have said of this grace through the mouth of a creature, would only stammer in comparison to your work!
**Reason:** In the name of God, sire Love, I have listened well to what has been said, and I have never listened more willingly, although I have not understood it perfectly; but that could not be, Love, except for the one to whom this gift is made.
**Love:** This is true for her as for the Holy Spirit himself.
**Reason:** And that is why I said that I cannot understand it, but it seems to me that everything this soul has done, and which comes from you, is very well done.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 39. Comment Raison veut servir cette âme et en être esclave

**Reason:** Now, Lord Love, I beg you, guide me, so that I may serve this soul in everything, as her pure slave, for I know that I can have no greater joy nor greater honor than to be the slave of this lady.
**Love:** I confess it to you, and you can do no better than to confess and say it.
**Reason:** Yes, dearest Love, but what shall I do with the people I have to govern, who will no longer see in this soul any disposition for their exercises and external affairs?
**Love:** Why do you say that? Is there a better disposition than that of this soul?
**Reason:** No, at least not for those who see a little clearly or for those who are chosen in this way; but there are few of them on earth, I dare say.
**Love:** Now, Reason, what do you call "disposition 1"?
**Reason:** I call "disposition" the life according to the works of the Virtues continually exercised under my counsel and that of Discernment, following the example of the works of Our Lord Jesus Christ.
**Love:** Reason, what the humanity of Jesus Christ suffered, the divinity did not feel. And I tell you the same, by comparison, of the one who is similar to him 2. Indeed, what you say about the Virtues or about yourself, Reason, this soul does not take into account. She can do better, for Love dwells in her, having transformed her into himself, so much so that this soul itself is Love, and Love has no discernment in him: one must have discernment in all things, but not in love. Here is a comparison: if a lord wants to collect the tribute of his land because it is rightfully due to him, it will not be the lord who owes the tribute to his serfs, but the serfs who owe it to their lord! Similarly, Reason, I tell you that all things owe me tribute when they are works of the Virtues advised by Reason and accomplished with Discernment; but not that one, and him alone, who is overwhelmed with love and transformed into Love: that one owes me nothing but love, and he is acquitted, for Love acquits him.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 40. Comment Amour appelle cette âme suprêmement sage, et

why
**Love:** I call this soul supremely wise among my chosen; but one who is short of sense cannot appreciate or know a thing of great value.
**Reason:** Yes, Lord Love, but what do you call wise?
**Love:** It is to be immersed in humility.
**Reason:** Yes, Love, but who is immersed in humility?
**Love:** The one who, having no fault in anything, yet knows that he is right in nothing.
The one who is in this knowledge of his fault sees so clearly that he sees himself below all creatures and in an ocean of sin. And because his enemies are slaves to sin and this soul has long seen that it is below them, also a slave to sin (without any comparison between it and them, given what it is and its works!), it has reduced itself to nothing by this consideration, and to less than nothing in all that it considers. It has long heard from the Holy Spirit that God would put the most abased at the most elevated, by His sole and loyal goodness 1.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 41. Comment l’âme n’éprouve aucun chagrin pour les

sins she has ever committed, nor any hope for the good she has
ever done
**Love:** For all that, this soul feels no sorrow for the sins she has
ever committed, nor any hope for anything she might do,
but only for the goodness of God. And the secret treasure of this sole goodness has
annihilated her to such an extent within herself, that she is dead to all manner of
feeling, inside and out, to the extent that she no longer performs any work,
neither for God nor for herself; and thus she has all her senses so lost in this
exercise, that she cannot seek God nor find Him, nor guide herself.
This soul is not with herself, so much so that she must be excused by all; and
the one in whom she is, does His work through her, and that is why she is well
absolved, by the testimony of God Himself who performs this work for her benefit,
she who has no work within her.
**Fear:** Yes, Love, but where then is this soul, since she is not with
herself?
**Love:** Where she loves, without feeling it. And it is because she does nothing
that comes from within herself, that this soul lives without reproach of
conscience. Indeed, he who does something of his own movement, he
is not without himself, but rather has Nature and Reason with him; thus,
he who is dead from love, feels nor knows neither Reason nor Nature. So much so that
this soul would want none of the joys of paradise, even if they were given
to her to choose, nor would she want to refuse any of the torments of hell, even if
it entirely depended on her will[^1].
**Holy Church[-the-Little][^2]:** But, in the name of God, what then[^3]?
**Love:** What she is in her knowledge.
**Holy Church[-the-Little]:** And what then is this soul? Dearest Holy Spirit,
teach us, for this word surpasses our scriptures, so much so that we cannot
understand by reason what it says: but it has so astonished us,
that we dare not oppose it.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 42. Comment le Saint-Esprit enseigne ce que sait cette âme, qu’elle

The Holy Spirit [to Sainte-Eglise-la-Petite]: O Sainte-Eglise, do you want to know what this soul knows and what it wants? I will tell you what it wants: this soul knows only one thing, which is that it knows nothing; thus it wants only one thing, and that is that it wants nothing. This knowing-nothing and wanting-nothing give it everything, and allow it to find the buried and hidden treasure, contained in the Trinity eternally. And this, not by divine nature, for that cannot be, but by the force of love, for it is fitting that it should be so.
Love [to Sainte-Eglise-la-Petite]: Now, Sainte-Eglise, you have heard why this soul possesses everything.
The Holy Spirit: Even more: everything that I hold from the Father and the Son. And since it has everything that I have, and the Father and the Son have nothing that I do not have in me, according to what Love says, this soul thus has, buried and contained within it, the treasure of the Trinity.
Sainte-Eglise[-la-Petite] to the Holy Spirit: Since this is so, it must be that the Trinity dwells and lives within it.
The Holy Spirit: That is right; since it is dead to the world and the world is dead in it, the Trinity will always dwell within it.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 43. Comment ces âmes sont appelées « Sainte-Eglise », et ce que

Holy Church can say of them
Holy Church[-the-Lesser]: O true God, Holy Spirit!
Love [to Holy Church-the-Lesser]: It is true,
Holy Church, you who are placed below that Holy Church! (Indeed, those souls are properly called Holy Church in that they support, teach, and nourish all Holy Church; and not they, but the entire Trinity through them; and it is the truth, let no one doubt it.) O Holy Church, you who are placed below that Holy Church, tell us now what you want to say about these souls, who are thus recommended and praised above you who exercise in all things the counsel of Reason?
Holy Church-the-Lesser: We want to say that these souls live above us, for Love dwells in them and Reason dwells in us; but this is not against us, on the contrary: we recommend and praise them through the hidden meaning of our writings.
Reason: But, sire Love, we would very much like to understand more openly, if it pleases you, this gift that the Holy Spirit gives to these souls in His pure goodness, but without anyone suffering any harm, due to their coarseness, in listening to this divine lesson.
Love: Yes, Reason, you will always be half-blind, you and all those who are nourished by your doctrine! For he is indeed half-blind, who sees things before his eyes and does not know them, which is your case!
The Holy Spirit: If I have said that I will give to this soul all that I have, I will give it to her; but it is rather the entire Trinity that has promised her all that we have, and it is granted to her by its goodness in the science of its Wisdom without beginning; thus it is only right that we withhold nothing from such souls that we have. Indeed, this soul has given us everything that is hers; and that which we have, it is she herself who has given it to us, if one can say so, for it is considered, and it is true, that good will takes the place of the work: this soul is of such a condition that, if she had in her that which we have, she would give it back to us just as we have it, without wanting any reward in heaven or on earth, solely for our will alone. We, we have the right to all this by our divine condition, but this soul gives it to us according to the mode of her will, which is contained in love without mode. And because this soul has given us all that she has, and all that is and that she does not have, according to the mode of her will, it is necessary, in the justice of love, that we give her what we have. And just as we have in us what we have by divine nature, this soul holds it from us in her by the justice of love.
Holy Church[-the-Lesser]: Yes, Lord, we understand and truly believe that your worthy nobility made this gift to her as a reward of love, for Love cannot be sufficiently rewarded in any way, except by Love.
Love: This soul has seen and known for a long time that there is no greater wisdom than temperance, nor greater wealth than being satisfied, nor greater strength than love. This soul has her memory, her understanding, and her will entirely submerged in a unique state, submerged in God; and this state gives her to be without knowing, nor feeling nor wanting any state, except only that which God has disposed. And for many days, she has languished in love.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 44. Quel est l'exercice de l'âme qui languit d’amour, et en quel

the state of the soul that has died of love
**Reason:** Well then! Lord Love, what is the occupation of a soul that languishes in love?
**Love:** It wages war against vices by acquiring virtues.
**The Soul:** Alas! Dearest Love, how great and perilous is this war! Surely, such an endeavor should indeed be called languor and a life of war!
**Love:** But now, it has languished so much in love that it has died of love.
**Reason:** In the name of God, Love, tell us in what state the soul that has died of love finds itself!
**Love:** It has finished with the world, and the world with it, and it has taken leave of it; therefore, it lives in God, and there, it can find neither sin nor vice. It is so buried and immersed in God that neither the world, nor the flesh, nor its enemies can trouble it, for they cannot find it in their works; thus this soul lives in rest and peace, for it accounts nothing created as its own. And because this soul is in such peace, it lives in the world without any remorse.
**Reason:** Also, this soul has no will; this state should be our state, for we have no higher merit before God than by relinquishing our will for His and by perfectly giving our will, wanting nothing, except only according to the measure of His operation and according to the dispositions of His goodness.
**The Soul:** This is what I adhere to, and therefore I lack nothing. Indeed, no soul possesses perfect peace except the one that has no will.
**Love:** What do you know of this, Madam?
**The Soul:** But yes, absolutely! This is what I do, Lord Love, for I have experienced it in harsh trials, and I came close to dying from it. And I would have died if the nothing-wanting had not saved me by the counsel of divine goodness. He who has no will, wants nothing; and he alone has given his will, and therefore he has nothing to want, except the will of the one to whom he has given his will.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 45. Comment ceux qui n’ont point de volonté vivent en la liberté de

charity
**Soul:** People who have no will live in the freedom of charity, and if someone were to ask them what they want, they would truthfully say that they want nothing. These people have come to the knowledge of their nothingness; that is to say, whatever is in them, they cannot know anything of their nothingness, for their knowledge has been too small to know this loss; they have come to trust in what surpasses them, and the knowledge that arises from this trust is in that one can know nothing of it.
**Reason:** Nothing?
**Love:** No; for if one knew as much as all that one will know in paradise, and even as much as all that one could compare it to through something one could partially or otherwise understand of it, all that one would understand then would be nothing; and what one would understand by this comparison would still be nothing beside it, if one abstracted from its power, its wisdom, its knowledge, and its goodness[^1]; and it would still be nothing if one added even a spark, no more, of its pure goodness. Whoever would grasp more of it than one will ever grasp, as it is said in this comparison, would still grasp nothing beside the smallest part that remains in it and that is grasped only by itself. In other words, to better understand, whoever would know of it all that is said of it, would still know nothing beside the great knowledge that remains in it outside of ours; yes, truly, what one could compare of the smallest part of its goodness by speaking of it, would still be nothing compared to the greatness that is truly its own, even less than a spark beside it in its entirety.
**Soul:** Lord God, what will the soul that believes this about you do?
**God:** It will do nothing, but I will do my work in it without it. Indeed, the knowledge of its nothingness and the trust in me have so reduced it to nothing, that it can do nothing; so much so that the knowledge of this nothingness, compared to the greatness of this whole, has entirely excused and freed it, for it lacks nothing, since it wants nothing.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 46. Comment l’âme a connaissance de ce qui la dépasse en ce que,

in her opinion, she knows nothing of God compared to what, in him, surpasses her
Love: Now, this soul has reached and come to know what surpasses her; yes truly, by the very fact that she knows nothing of God in regard to what he is entirely.
Reason: Hey there! Will one dare to call "nothing" something that belongs to God?
The soul: Yes indeed! And how so! Truly, it is indeed nothing, all that can or could be given to us from him. Yes, truly, even supposing that he gives us what is said above in this writing; for in comparison, if it could be that it were true, it would still be nothing compared to a single spark of his goodness, but it remains in his knowledge and outside of ours.
Oh, oh! And what to say of him entirely, since one can say so much good of what is lesser than him? Yes, dearest and beloved, that, you alone know, and it suffices me that it is so.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 47. Comment l’âme en est venue à la connaissance de son néant

**Love:** You have thus heard how this soul came to trust in what surpasses her. Now, I will tell you how she came to the knowledge of her nothingness: it is by knowing that neither she nor anyone else knows anything of her horrible sins and faults, compared to what they are in the knowledge of God. This soul has retained no will, but rather she has come and arrived at wanting nothing, and in a certain knowledge of knowing nothing; and this knowing-nothing and wanting-nothing have excused and liberated her. This soul adheres to the counsel of the Gospel saying: "Let your eye be single, and thus you will not sin[^1]."

Thus this soul is peaceful in all that God endures from her, for she understands everything according to the truth and remains in a peaceful rest no matter what her neighbor does. Indeed, in all that she does not understand, she passes no judgment, except always for the good.

This soul finds her peace everywhere, for she carries it continually with her, so much so that in this peace all places suit her, and all things as well. And she sits without moving on the throne of Peace which is in the book of life[^2], with the testimony of a good conscience and in the Freedom of perfect charity.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 48. Comment l’âme n’est pas libre lorsqu’elle désire que la volonté

of God be done in her to His honor
**Love:**
Henceforth, the soul wants nothing more, since she is free; indeed, he who wants something from his own inner will is not free, whatever he may wish, for he is a slave to himself as long as he wants God to do his will for his own honor; he who wants this does not want it solely to fulfill the will of God in himself and in others. To such people, God has refused His kingdom.
**Reason:**
But certainly, that is how they would act.
**The Soul:**
Yes, truly, that is how they would act, for they must under penalty of losing the little profit that is theirs.
**Reason:**
It is true, Madam, I confess it to you.
**Love:**
These people are ill at peace, whatever they may think; and because they think so, their state suffices for them.
**The Soul:**
They are not rich enough to think that there is someone greater than themselves, and this prevents them from becoming better, and thus they remain with their good intentions.
**Love:**
These people, they have never been satisfied!
**The Liberated Soul:**
No, certainly; since their will remains, they are slaves to it. In this servitude, the soul who trusts completely in these two Virtues, Reason and Fear, and in this tyrannical will; whereas only he is free, who is governed by Faith and Love, for they draw him out of all servitude, without fearing dreadful things nor desiring any of the most delightful things.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 49. Comment est noble cette âme qui n’a point de volonté

**Love:** This soul has no will, and therefore, it does not care whether God does this or that, but that He always does His will. Indeed, this soul is liberated and content: it needs neither hell, nor paradise, nor any created thing; it neither wants nor does not want anything that is named here.

**Holy-Church-the-Little:** But, in the name of God, how is that?

**Love:** Nothing, it wants nothing. But saying this seems very strange to those who expect large returns from the yield of love! It is not a wonder, but while no one could think or believe without being mistaken that this is a great harm to them, it seems strange to them.

**The Soul:** These people are so blinded that a great thing seems small to them.

**Love:** It is true, dear soul, what you say there; for as much as the work of God is better than the work of a creature, so much better is this nothing-wanting in God than the good will for God. Better: supposing that, by this good will, these people could perform miracles and receive martyrdom every day for the love of God, there would still be no comparison between the two, since their will remains. And there would still be none if, thanks to this will, they were every day taken up to heaven to see the Trinity, as it was for the apostle Saint Paul.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 50. Comment cette âme porte la marque de Dieu, telle la cire celle

**Love:** This soul bears the mark of God, and its true imprint is maintained by the union of love; and just as wax takes the shape of the seal, this soul takes the mark of this model.
**The Soul:** Indeed, however much God loves us, as He has shown through His divine works and His human sufferings, He does not love us against His will; and if He died for us, and took on human flesh for us, it was of His own free will, as a testimony of His goodness; and He owed it to me, since His divine will desired it. No, He did not love us against His will! Indeed, if everything that the Trinity had created in its knowledge were to be damned without end, Jesus Christ, Son of God, would not have deviated from the truth to save us all.
Woe is me! From where comes what I have said? Does not everyone know that this cannot be?
**Love:** Yes, dearest and beloved, my beloved ones know that this cannot be.
**God the Father:** But you, who are my dearest beloved, you say this because such must be my eldest daughter, the heir to my kingdom, the one who knows the secrets of the Son through the love of the Holy Spirit who has given them to this soul.[^1]

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 51. Comment cette âme est semblable à la divinité

**Love:** It is necessary that this soul be similar to the divinity, for it is transformed into God, whereby its true form is maintained, which is granted and given to it without beginning by the one who has always loved it in his goodness.

**The soul:** Yes, Love, the wisdom of what is said has reduced me to nothing, and this very annihilation has plunged me into an abyss more unfathomable than what is less than nothing. And the knowledge of my annihilation has given me everything, and the annihilation of this everything has taken away prayer and supplication from me, and I no longer pray for anything.

**Holy-Church-the-Little:** And what do you do then, most dear lady and mistress?

**The soul:** I rest in complete peace, alone, reduced to nothing, entirely at the courtesy of the sole goodness of God, without a single desire making me move, whatever its richness. The fulfillment of my work is to always want nothing. For as long as I want nothing, I am alone in him, without myself, and entirely liberated; whereas in wanting something, I am with myself, and thus I lose my Freedom. And if I want nothing, if I have lost everything outside of my desire, I lack nothing: free is my conduct, and I want nothing from anyone.

**Love:** O most precious Esther[^1], you who have lost all exercise, and whose exercise, by this loss, is to do nothing, yes, you are truly most precious! For, in truth, this exercise and this loss are made in the annihilation of your beloved, and in this annihilation, you swoon and remain dead, while you live, beloved, totally in his will: this is his chamber, and it is there that he pleases to dwell.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 52. Comment Amour fait l’éloge de cette âme, et comment elle

dwells in the abundance and riches of divine love
Love, to this precious pearl[^1]: Welcome, noble lady, to the only free
manor in which no one enters unless they are of your lineage and without bastardy.
[To the listeners[^2]:] This soul has entered into the abundance and riches of
divine love; not that she has reached it through divine knowledge, for it cannot
be that an understanding, however illuminated it may be, can attain anything of
the riches of divine love, but the love of this soul is so united with the riches of
the excellence of this excess of divine love — it is not the understanding of love,
but its excess of love that attains it —, that she finds herself adorned with the ornaments
of this excess of peace in which she lives, endures, is, was, and will be without her
own being[^3]. Indeed, just as iron takes on fire and loses its aspect because
the fire that transforms it into itself is stronger than it[^4], this soul takes on what, here, surpasses her; she is nourished and transformed in it due to her love for it, without
considering what does not surpass her; rather, she dwells and is
transformed in what surpasses her from this excess of eternal peace, without being
found anywhere: she loves in the sweet land of the excess of peace, so much so that there
is nothing that can help or trouble those who love her, neither creature, nor given thing, nor anything that God promises.
Reason: What is this then?
Love: It is what never was given, nor is, nor will be, that has stripped her
bare and reduced her to nothing, without her caring for anything that exists, nor wanting to be
helped or spared by its power, its wisdom, or its goodness.
The soul, speaking of her beloved: He is, that does not fail him; and I am not, so that does not fail me either[^5] and he has given me peace; and I live only by the peace that is born of his gifts in my soul, without thought;
and thus I can do nothing if it is not given to me: that is my all and what I have
of best. And this state makes one possess a single
love, a single will, and a single operation in two natures: such is the power
of the annihilation of the unity of divine justice.
[Love, to the listeners[^6]:] This soul lets the dead bury the dead[^7] and the
lost act according to the Virtues, and she rests from what does not surpass her in
what surpasses her, while using all things. What surpasses her shows her her naked nothingness and without disguise, and this nakedness shows her the Almighty
through the goodness of divine justice. These considerations make her deep, wide,
high, and assured, for they keep her, as long as they hold her, continually bare,
both all and nothing.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 53. Comment Raison demande explication de ce qui est dit plus

Reason: Dearest Soul, immersed in the bottomless depths of complete humility!  
Most precious stone, you whom Truth carries on its plain! You, the unique  
sovereign, but not over those of your domain, I beg you: tell us what  
these veiled words used by Perfect Love mean!  
**Soul:**  
Reason, if someone told you and you heard it, you would  
still not understand. Thus, your questions have dishonored and spoiled  
this book, for there are people who would have understood it in a few words, whereas  
they have lengthened it because of the answers you and those  
you have nurtured, who advance at a snail's pace, need. Indeed, you have  
opened it to those of your house, and they go at a snail's pace!  
**Love:**  
Opened? Yes, truly, in that Reason and all those who are in its  
school cannot protest that it does not seem well said to them, whatever  
understanding they may have of it.  
**Soul:**  
It is true, for only he understands it,  
who masters Perfect Love; thus he must be dead of all mortal death,  
he who understands it with finesse, for no one tastes this life unless he is dead of  
all death.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 54. Raison demande de combien de morts il faut que l’âme

before one understands this book
**Reason:** Well then! Treasurer of Love, tell us how many kinds of deaths
you had to die, before you understood this book with finesse.
**The Soul:** Ask Love, for he knows the truth of it.
**Reason:** Well then! Lord Love, thank God! tell us, and not only for
me and those I have nourished, but also for those who have taken leave of me
and to whom this book will bring, if it pleases God, the light.
**Love:** Reason, those who have taken leave of you will still make something of
your nourishment regarding the two deaths by which this soul has died and truly died[^1];
but the third death by which it has died, no living person understands it, except the one
who stands on the mountain[^2].
**Reason:** In the name of God, tell us then who are the people of the mountain!
**Love:** They are those who have on earth neither shame, nor honor, nor fear of anything
that may happen to them.
**Reason:** My God! Lord Love, in the name of God, answer our questions before
going further! For I fear and I am terrified to listen to the life of this soul.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 55. Comment Amour répond aux questions de Raison

**Love:**  
Reason, those who live as this book says (those who have reached the state proper to this life) understand it quickly without ever needing to explain the hidden meaning. But I will explain something about your questions; now, understand:  
There are two kinds of people who lead a life of perfection according to the works of virtue in spiritual affection.  
Some are those who totally mortify their bodies by doing works of charity; but they take such pleasure in their works that they are not aware that there is a better state than that of the works of virtue and the death of the martyr, than the desire to persevere in it with the help of a prayer full of prayers and the abundance of good will; and, always because of the constancy they put into it, they think that this is the best of all the states that can be. These people are happy, but they perish in their works because of the sufficiency they put into their state. They are called kings, but it is in the land where everyone is one-eyed; and surely, those who have two eyes consider them slaves.  

**The Soul:**  
Yes, slaves, they truly are, but they do not know it. They resemble the owl who thinks there is no more beautiful bird in the woods than her owlets! Like her, those who live in perpetual desire think and believe that there is no better state than that of desiring, a state in which they remain and want to remain; and they perish on the way because they place their satisfaction in what desire and will give them.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 56. Comment les Vertus se plaignent d’Amour qui leur porte si peu

**The Virtues:** Alas, my God! Lord Love, who then will bring us honor, since you say that those who live entirely under our counsel perish? Truly, if someone else told us this, we would consider them a fool[^1] and a bad Christian! For we cannot understand that anyone could perish by entirely following our teaching, in the ardor of the desire that gives the true way to feel Jesus Christ; and yet, we believe perfectly and without a shadow of a doubt, Lord Love, everything you say.

**Love:** It is true; but to understand this, that is the mark of a master, for there lies the grain of the divine food.

**The Virtues:** We believe it, Love, but it is not thanks to our office that we understand it. However, we are well acquitted, if we believe you, whatever understanding we may have of it, for we are made by you to serve such souls.

**The Soul, to the Virtues:** Indeed, that is well said, one must certainly believe you! And that is why I declare this to all those who will hear this book: whoever serves a poor lord for a long time, expects poor wages, and little pay! Now, it is thus that the Virtues have well recognized and perceived — let those who have ears hear! — that they do not understand the state of Perfect Love. Therefore, I say this: how will the Virtues teach their subjects what they do not have and will never have? So, whoever wants to understand and learn how those who remain in the Virtues perish, let them ask Love, I mean that Love who is master of Knowledge, and not the love who is its son, for he knows nothing of it; better yet: let them ask the Love who is father of Knowledge and of divine Light, for he knows everything about it, because of what, in this whole, surpasses this soul; and she stops there and remains there, so that she can only make her dwelling in this whole.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 57. De ceux qui sont en l’état des égarés, et comment ils sont

slaves and merchants[^1]
Love: You now know which people have perished, in what, from what, and why. Now, we will also tell you who the lost ones are, those who are slaves and merchants; however, they act more wisely than those who have perished.
**Soul:** Well then! Lord Love, you who make everything light, tell us, by Love, why they remain in virtues as much as those who have perished, and why they serve them, those who feel and desire in the ardor of the cutting edge of the operation of the spirit. Those who have perished do this as much as the lost ones; where then is the better thing that makes you praise them more than those who have perished?
Love: Where is it? In many places, for that is all that is good to come to the state from which those who have perished can no longer receive any help.
**Freed Soul:** Well then! Love of divine Love, I beg you to tell us why these lost ones are wise, compared to those who have perished, when their exercise is the same, except in this wisdom for which you appreciate them more than the others.
Love: It is because they hold that there is a better state than theirs; they also know well that they have no knowledge of this better state in which they believe. And the fact of believing in it gives them so little knowledge and satisfaction in their state, that they consider themselves bad and lost. And indeed, they are truly so, compared to the Freedom of those who are in this better state and who never move. And because they hold and know in truth that they are lost, they often ask their way with ardent desire, to the one who knows it, that is to say, to lady Knowledge, illuminated by divine grace. And their questions move this lady — those who have been lost know this well — and that is why she teaches them the right royal path through the land of nothing-wanting. This direction is the right one: whoever takes it knows if I speak the truth, and they know it too, these lost people who consider themselves bad; indeed, if they are lost, they can come to the state of the free people we speak of, thanks to the teaching of this divine light, to whom this humble and lost soul asks for its way and direction.
Reason: Of humble condition? Yes indeed, and more than humble!
The Holy Spirit adds: It is true as long and as much as she will ask questions to Knowledge and to Love, and will take into account things that can neither be in love, nor in knowledge, nor in praise; for no wise person prays without reason nor cares about what cannot be. And that is why one can well say that he is of humble and poor condition, who asks much, or even who does not ask much. Indeed, any other state, whatever it may be, than the sovereign state of nothing-wanting in which those who are free stand without moving, is but a ball game and a child's play, compared to it; indeed, he who is free in the state that belongs to him, could neither refuse, nor want, nor promise anything because of what could be given to him, but he would want to give everything because of the loyalty he wants to keep.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 58. Comment les âmes anéanties sont au cinquième état1 avec leur

Beloved
Reason: In the name of God, but what can souls annihilated to this extent give?
Love: What can they give? But everything that God disposes of! The soul that is thus has neither perished nor is lost, it is rather in the transports of the fifth state with its lover. There, it does not fail, so much so that it is often carried away to the sixth state; but this lasts only a short time, for it is an opening that comes like a flash: it closes immediately and one cannot remain there long; and never has a master been found who knew how to speak of it.
By the peace of its operation, the rapture that overflows from this opening after it has closed, makes the soul so free, so noble, and so unencumbered by anything — as long as the peace given in this opening lasts — that he who would maintain himself in freedom after this adventure would find himself in the fifth state without falling back into the fourth; indeed, in the fourth, one has will, whereas in the fifth one has none. And because there is no will in the fifth state of which this book speaks — a state where the soul remains after the operation of *Loin-Près* which ravishes it, and which we call a flash similar to an opening immediately closed — no one could believe what extreme peace this soul receives, except itself.
[To the listeners:] For the love of God, understand this divinely, listeners of this book. This *Loin-Près*, which we call a flash similar to an opening immediately closed, takes the soul to the fifth state and carries it to the sixth as long as its operation is exercised, so that there is a new state; but this sixth state lasts only a short time, for it is brought back to the fifth. And this is not surprising, for the operation of this flash, as long as it lasts, is nothing other than the appearance of the glory of the soul. This does not remain long in a creature, but only the time to manifest itself. And this gift is noble in that it produces its work in the soul before it appears to it and it becomes aware of it. But the peace produced by my operation and which remains in the soul as long as I produce it there, it is so delightful that Truth calls it "glorious nourishment"; and no one can be nourished by it if he remains in desire. The people who experience this would govern a country if needed, but everything would be done without them.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 59. De quoi vécut cette âme ; comment et quand elle est sans elle-

**Love:** In the beginning, this soul lived in a life of grace, grace born from the death of sin. Then, it lived in a spiritual life, life born from the death of nature; and now, it lives in a divine life, life born from the death of the spirit. This soul, living in a divine life, is perpetually without itself.

**Reason:** In the name of God, and when then is this soul without itself?

**Love:** When it is with itself.

**Reason:** And when is it with itself?

**Love:** When it is nowhere of its own will, neither in God, nor in itself, nor in its neighbor, but in the annihilation that this flash operates in it at the approach of its operation. This operation is so preciously noble that, just as one cannot speak of the opening of a single movement of glory given by the amiable flash, there is no soul to speak of the precious closing that makes it forget itself by annihilating the knowledge that this annihilation gives of itself.

**The Soul:** My God! What a great lord, he who could understand the profit of a single movement of such annihilation!

**Love:** Yes, indeed.

**The Soul, to the listeners of this book:** In what has just been said, you have heard words of high elevation! Therefore, if it pleases you, I will now speak of humble things; I must do so if I want to accomplish the enterprise I have projected, not for those who are already there, but for those who are not yet there and who will be one day, even if they must be deprived of it as long as they remain with themselves.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 60. Comment il faut mourir de trois morts avant de venir à la vie

free and annihilated
**Love:**
You have asked us, Reason, how many deaths one must die before coming to this life. I answer you this: before the soul can be born into this life, it must die entirely three deaths. The first is the death to sin, as you have heard; the soul must die to it entirely, in such a way that there remains in it neither color, nor taste, nor smell of anything that God forbids in the Law. Those who die thus live in a life of grace, and it suffices for them to refrain from doing what God forbids and to be able to do what God commands.
[To the annihilated souls:]
Yes, very noble people, you who are annihilated and elevated in great astonishment and admiration by the conjunction that the union of Divine Love operates, do not be displeased if I touch on certain things for people of humble condition, for I will soon speak of your state. In the meantime, putting white and black together makes these two colors better seen by each other than by themselves.
[To the disciples of Reason:]
Now, you who are chosen and called to this sovereign state, understand and hasten, for the road is very great and the path is long between the first state of grace and the last state of glory that the amiable Far-Near gives. If I ask you to understand and hasten, it is because understanding this is both difficult, subtle, and very noble; the sanguine are helped by nature, but without the haste of the sharp will of the ardor of the spirit's desire that it gives to the choleric. So much so that when these two natures are united, namely the nature and the ardor of the spirit's desire, it is a very great advantage, for people of this kind adhere and attach themselves so strongly to what they undertake, that they are entirely where they apply themselves, by the force of desire and nature; and when these two natures agree with the third which, by justice, must join them forever (that is to say, to the abyss of glory which, by justice, naturally attracts them in its nature), this agreement is of refined nobility. And to better understand this, I pose the following question: what is the noblest thing, the abyss that attracts the soul and beautifies it with the beauty of its nature, or the soul that is united to this glory?
**The soul [to the listeners:**]
I do not know if this bores you, but I cannot do better. Excuse me, but Jealousy of Love and Work of Charity, with which I was burdened, have made this book so that you may come to this without delay, at least in will, if you still have it. And if you are already unburdened of all things, if you are people without will and leading a life that is above your understanding, it has been made so that at least you may speak of its hidden meaning.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 61. Où Amour parle des sept états de l’âme1

**Love:** I said that there are seven states of the soul, each more difficult to understand than the last and incomparable to one another; for what one might say of a drop of water next to the entire sea in its immensity, one could say of the first state of grace next to the second, and so on for the others, without comparison between them. However, among the first four, there is none so great that the soul does not live in very great slavery; but the fifth is in the Freedom of charity, for it is unburdened of all things; and the sixth is glorious, for the opening of the sweet movement of glory that the amiable Far-Near gives is nothing other than an apparition that God wants the soul to have of its own glory which it will possess without end. And that is why He shows it by His goodness in the sixth state what belongs to the seventh; this manifestation comes from the seventh state and procures the sixth, but it is given so quickly, that the very one to whom it is given does not perceive at all the gift that is made to her.

**Soul:** What is so marvelous about that? If I perceived it before this gift was made to me, I would be in myself, by divine goodness, what the given is and what it will give me without end when my body has left my soul.

**The Spouse of this soul:** That does not depend on her: by my Far-Near, I have sent you an advance. But some ask me who this Far-Near is, and what are its works and operations when it shows its glory to the soul; it is that, indeed, nothing can be said about it, except that the Far-Near is the Trinity itself, and this manifestation that it operates for the soul, we call it "movement," not that the soul or the Trinity move, but because the Trinity operates for this soul the manifestation of its glory. Of this, no one can speak, except the divinity itself; for the soul to whom this Far-Near gives itself has such great knowledge of God, of itself, and of all things, that it sees in God Himself, by divine knowledge, that the light of that knowledge takes away from it the knowledge of itself, of God, and of all things.

**Soul:** It is true, there is nothing else to say. And yet, if God wants me to have this great knowledge, let Him take it away from me and prevent me from knowing it, for otherwise, I would have no knowledge of it. And if He wants me to know myself, let Him also take away the knowledge of myself, for otherwise, I cannot have it either.

**Love:** Madam, what you say is true: but there is nothing more certain to know nor more profitable to possess than that work.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 62. De ceux qui sont morts au péché mortel et nés à la vie de grâce1

**Love:** Now, Reason, understand: I return to our subject for people of humble condition. These people we have spoken of, who have died to mortal sin and been born to the life of grace, they feel no reproach or remorse of conscience as long as they fulfill what God commands. They desire honors and are dismayed if they are despised, but they guard against vain glory and impatience which leads to the death of sin. They love riches and are sad when they are poor—and if they are rich, losing something makes them sad—but they always guard against the death of sin, and do not want to love their riches against God's will, neither in loss nor in gain. And they love to be at ease and rest at their pleasure, but they guard against disorder. These people are dead to mortal sin and born to the life of grace.

**Soul:** My faith! These people, their condition is very humble on earth and even more humble in heaven! And it is in a very little courteous manner that they save themselves!

**Reason:** Hold on! Madam, be careful what you say! We would not dare say of anyone that they are of humble condition when they will see God without end!

**Love:** Truly, one could not describe their pettiness, compared to the nobility of those who die the death to nature and live the life according to the spirit.

**Reason:** I believe it well; that is what they do, and if they said otherwise, they would lie; and yet, they do not want to do anything for this nobility. They tell me, Reason, that they are not bound to it if they do not want to, for God has not commanded it to them: He has indeed advised it, nothing more.

**Soul:** They speak the truth, but they are little courteous!

**Desire:** My faith, yes! They are very little courteous! They have forgotten that it would not have sufficed for Jesus Christ to do for them less than all that humanity can endure unto death.

saved
**Soul:** Yes, dear Jesus Christ, do not worry about those people! They seek their own interest so much that they forget you, in the grossness where they find their satisfaction.
**Love:** Indeed, that is great villainy!
**Soul:** These are the ways of merchants, those whom the world calls "villains," for they are. Indeed, a gentleman would never engage in trade or seek his own interest. But I will tell you how I will find rest from these people: sire Love, it is in that they are excluded from the court of your secrets, as a villain would be from a gentleman's court during a judgment among peers, for there, no one can be present who is not of high lineage, at least when it comes to the court of a king. And in this, I find peace, for they too are excluded from the court of your secrets, while others are called there, those who will never forget the works of your sweet courtesy, that is to say, the scorns, the poverties, and the unbearable torments that you endured for us: they will never forget the gifts of your suffering; rather, it is always a mirror and a model for them.
**Love:** To these people, every necessary thing is granted, for Jesus Christ promised it in the Gospel [^1]. They are saved infinitely more courteously than the others; and yet, they are still people of humble condition, so humble, even, that it cannot be said, compared to the nobility of those who have died to life according to the spirit.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 64. Où l’on parle des âmes mortes à la vie selon l’esprit

**Love:** Of this life, no one tastes unless they have died this death.

**Truth:** This death carries away the flower of the love of divinity. There is no intermediary between these souls and divinity; and they do not want one either. They cannot bear the memory of any human love nor the desire for divine ways of feeling, because of the pure divine love they bear for Love. This sole possession of Love gives them the flower of the effervescence of love, by the testimony of Love itself.

**Love[^1]:** It is true. The love we speak of is the union of lovers, it is a blazing fire that burns without faltering.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 65. Où l'on parle de ceux qui siègent sur la haute montagne, au-

**Love:** Here, Reason; you have heard something about the three deaths from which one comes to these three lives. Now, I will tell you who sits on the mountain, above the winds and the rains: they are those who have on earth neither shame, nor honor, nor fear of anything that may happen. These people are in safety, so much so that their doors remain open without anyone being able to bother them and without the work of charity daring to enter: they are the ones who sit on the mountain, and no one else.

**Reason:** In the name of God, sire Love, tell us what will become of Modesty, the most beautiful of Humility's daughters; and Fear, too, who has done so much good for this soul and rendered her so many fine services; and what will become of me, who have not slept as long as they have needed me! Alas! Will we then be cast out of her home because she has become its mistress?

**Love:** Not at all; on the contrary, all three of you will remain part of her household, and you will be three guardians at her door, so that if anyone wanted to enter her abode and was against Love, each of you would awaken; but do not show yourselves for any other duty than that of doorkeeper, for the matter would turn to your confusion; besides, you would only be listened to in this capacity and no other, and even then, only if this soul falls so low that there is need or necessity. Indeed, this creature is rather clothed in the divine life we have spoken of, than in the spirit placed in her own body at her creation. Thus, her body is rather clothed in her spirit, than her spirit is in her body, for the coarseness of the body is removed and diminished by the divine operation; so much so that this soul is rather in the sweet land of the unknown-nothing, where she loves, than in her own body to which she gives life: such is the power of the Freedom of Love.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 66. Comment l’âme se réjouit d’avoir pris congé de Raison et des

other Virtues
Holy-Little-Church: Well then! dear and divine Love...
**Soul:** Yes, truly it is little! for it will not wait long to come to its
end[^1], which will bring it great joy.
**Reason:** However, tell me then what has most delighted you within
yourself.
**Soul:** Lord Love will say it for me.
**Love:** It is having taken leave of you and the works of the Virtues! For when
this soul was invested[^2] with love, it took lessons at your school by desiring the
works of the Virtues. But it is now so advanced and elevated in the divine lesson,
that it begins to read where you end; and this lesson is not written by the hand of man, but by the Holy Spirit who writes it
marvelously, and the soul is the precious parchment: it is in her that the
divine school resides, with closed mouth, and human wisdom cannot put it into
words.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 67. Où l’on parle du pays où cette âme demeure, et de la Trinité

**Reason:** Well then, Love, I would ask you to tell me something more about the country where this soul dwells.

**Love:** I tell you that he who is where this soul is, is of himself, in himself, and by himself, without receiving anything from anyone, except from himself alone. Now, this soul is in him, of him, and for him, without receiving anything from anyone, except from him alone.

**Truth:** She is therefore in God the Father, for we believe that there is no person in the Trinity who has received anything from another except from the Father alone.

**Love:** It is true, for God the Father possesses the divine power of himself, without receiving it from anyone; indeed, what he possesses emanates from his divine power, and he gives to his Son that very thing which he possesses of himself, and the Son receives it from the Father, so that the Son is born of the Father and is equal to him. As for the Holy Spirit, he is of the Father and of the Son, a person in the Trinity; not born, but is, for it is one thing that the Son is born of the Father, another thing that the Holy Spirit is of both the Father and the Son.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 68. Comment cette âme est unie à la Trinité par opération divine, et

how she treats as donkeys those who live by the counsel of Reason
Love: This soul is entirely melted, liquefied, and absorbed in the high
Trinity, joined and united to it; and it can will nothing other than the divine will,
by the divine operation of the entire Trinity. A clarity, a ravishing light
unites with it and presses it most closely, and thus it speaks thus:
**Soul:** O wretched, rude, and inappropriate people!
**Reason:** To whom do you speak?
**Soul:** To all those who live by your counsel, who are so foolish and so asinine that I
must conceal my language because of their coarseness, and not speak it, for fear
they might find death in the state of life, where I am in peace without moving;
to all those, because of their coarseness, I say that I must keep silent and
conceal my language, the one I learned in secret at the secret court of the sweet
country; in this country, courtesy is law, love is measure, and goodness, nourishment; the
sweetness attracts me, the beauty pleases me, the goodness feeds me; what more can I
do now, since I live in peace?

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 69. Où l’âme dit que l’exercice des Vertus n’est qu’inquiétude et

Reason: In the name of God, very sweet and spotless flower, what do you think of our exercise?

**Soul:**
**It seems to me that it is a labor full of worries! Nevertheless, it is in these worries that one earns their bread and sustenance through their toil; and Jesus Christ ennobles it with his own body, he who saw the animality of those who would be saved in this labor and who needed to be assured of it:** Jesus Christ, who did not want to lose them, guaranteed it to them himself through his death, through his Gospels and through his Scriptures, where the laborers seek the right path.

Reason: And you, where do you seek the right path, our very dear lady, you who do and take your labor not in this anxiety, but through the faith from which you receive these gifts?

**Soul:**
**No indeed, I am free from that! What I have of the best is elsewhere and so far from it, that it could not be compared:** the end of it is in God who is not in time, while I am here to reach it through him; for what I have of the best is that I am established in my annihilation.
Now, Reason, you ask us where we find the right path; I tell you that it is with the one who is so strong, that he can never die, and whose doctrine is not written, whether by exemplary works or by the doctrine of men, for the gift he gives cannot be given in a limited form. He has always known that I trust him without witness: is there any greater vileness than wanting witnesses in love?
No, certainly, it seems to me; since Love is witness enough for me: if I wanted more, I would not trust him.

Reason: Yes, Madam, but you have two laws, namely yours and ours: ours to believe, and yours to love. However, please tell us why you have called those we nourish "beasts" and "asses"!

**Soul:**
**These people whom I call asses, they seek God in creatures, in monasteries through prayers, in created paradises, human words and Scriptures. Surely, Benjamin is not born among these people, for Rachel lives in them; whereas Rachel must die at the birth of Benjamin, and until Rachel is dead, Benjamin cannot be born. It seems to the novices that the people who seek God thus through the mountains and valleys, claim that he is subject to his sacraments and his works. Alas! What a pity for all their woes, and for all those they will have as long as they remain in this way of doing and this exercise! While they have a good time and enjoy themselves, those who worship God not only in temples and monasteries, but everywhere and through union with the divine will!

Reason:** Yes, but you who are so well-born, tell us, in the name of God: where do you seek him, and where do you find him?

**Soul:**
**I find him everywhere, and that is where he is. He is a single divinity, a single God in three persons, and this God is entirely everywhere:** that is where I find him.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 70. Comment cette âme est ce qu’elle est par la grâce de Dieu1

**Reason:** Now, our dear lady, tell us a bit about who you are, to speak to us in this way.
**The soul:** I am what I am by the grace of God. I am therefore only what God is in me and nothing else; and God also is that very thing which He is in me. Indeed, nothing is nothing, and what is, is; and thus, I am not, if I am, but what God is, and no one is, except God; and that is why I find only God, wherever I penetrate, for nothing is, except Him, to tell the truth.
This soul loves in truth, that is to say in divinity, but Truth loves in the one from whom this soul holds its being; thus the whole work of Charity is accomplished in her.
**Love:** It is true, for all souls, except this one, hide themselves for lack of innocence, because of Adam's sin.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 80. Comment l’âme chante et déchante

**Soul:** For a moment I sing, another I unsing[^1], but all this for those who are not yet free, so that they may hear some points concerning freedom and what is needed to achieve it.

**Love:** By a divine light, this soul has glimpsed the state of the land where it must be, and it has crossed the sea to suck the marrow of the high cedar[^2]. Indeed, no one takes or reaches this marrow, if they do not cross the high sea and drown their will in its waves. You who love, understand what this means.

I have just said that, through me, this soul has come to nothing, and even to less than infinitely nothing: indeed, just as God is ungraspable in his power, this soul is indebted to its ungraspable annihilation for a single hour of time where it has set its will against him. It owes him, without reduction, the debt that its will deserves, and this as many times as it has wanted to steal it from him.

**Soul:** O true God, you who see and endure this, who then will pay this debt? (Answering herself:) Well! dear Lord, you will pay it yourself! For the full goodness that emanates from your courtesy could not bear that I should not be acquitted of it by the gift of Love, from him to whom you make pay in an instant all my debts. This very sweet Far-Near has borne the last penny of my debt, and he tells me that you have as much to return to me as I to you. Indeed, if I owe you as much as you are worth, you owe me as much as you have, for such is the generosity of your divine nature. And, moreover, this amiable Far-Near of whom I have just spoken says that these two debts must cancel each other out and henceforth make only one; and I agree, for this is the counsel of my neighbor.

**Reason:** But, in the name of God, Madam, who then is your closest neighbor?

**Soul:** It is the exaltation that ravishes me: it invades me and unites me to the heart of the marrow of divine Love, and I am liquefied by it[^3]; it is therefore just that I remember him, for I am abandoned in him. One must be silent about this state, for nothing can be said about it.

**Love:** Nothing, it is true. No more than one could confine the sun for long, this soul cannot truly say anything about this life, compared to what it really is.

**Astonishment:** Yes, Madam, you are a source of divine love, a source where the fountain of divine knowledge takes birth, a source and fountain where the river of divine praise takes birth.

**Soul, confirmed in its annihilation:** I abandon everything perfectly, to the divine will.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 91. Comment la volonté de ces âmes est la volonté d'Amour ; quelle

is the reason
**Soul:** Those do nothing that does not please them, and if they did, they would
deprive themselves of peace, freedom, and nobility. Indeed, a soul
is not accomplished as long as it does not do what pleases it and does not feel
any remorse in doing its good pleasure.
**Love:** That is right, for its will is ours: it has crossed the Red Sea and its
enemies remained there[^1]. Its good pleasure is our will, due to the purity of
the unity of the will of the divinity, where we have enclosed it. Its will is ours,
for it has fallen from grace into the perfection of the work of the Virtues, from the Virtues
into Love, from Love into Nothingness, and from Nothingness into the glorification[^2] of God, which
is seen through the eyes of his majesty who has here glorified it by himself. Thus it is
so surrendered to him, that it no longer sees either itself or him; and that is why he sees
himself alone, due to his divine goodness. He will be by himself in this goodness that he
had of himself before the soul existed and that he gave it his goodness of which he made it
sovereign: such was his free will, and he cannot find it again by himself without
the good pleasure of the soul; but he finds it now without any "why",
at the very point where he had it before it became sovereign. No one saw
this but him, no one loves but him, for no one exists but him; and for
that reason, he alone loves, he alone sees himself and alone praises himself for what he is in himself.
And here, I stop, for it is the noblest state that the soul can know
here below.
But there are five states below that one[^3], and one must go through each
of them to the end, before the soul can receive this sixth, which is
the most profitable, the noblest, and the most lovable of all. As for the seventh, it
is in paradise, and it is perfect without lacking anything. Thus God performs his
divine works in his creatures by his goodness: where he is, the Holy Spirit
blows, and that is how he performs his wonders in them.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 92. Comment l’âme se désencombre de Dieu, d’elle-même et de son

**The satisfied soul:** Yes, Lord, you have suffered so much for us, and you have accomplished so many things in us, by yourself and of yourself, that these two works have come to an end in us, but very late! Now, do your work in us by yourself, for ourselves and without ourselves, as it pleases you, Lord. For as for me, henceforth, I fear nothing more; I unburden myself of you, of myself and of my neighbor, and I will tell you how: I abandon you, I abandon myself and I abandon all my neighbors to the knowledge of your divine wisdom, to the power of your divine might and to the governance of your divine goodness, and this, for your sole divine will. And only these divine things, annihilated, illuminated and glorified by the divine majesty, have freed me from all things; and this without return, for otherwise, if something were missing, it would not be a gift.

**The same, to the slaves of Reason and Nature, to make them envious:**
Now, if you want and if you have received this gift, understand: I owe nothing, if Love is not a slave or if nothing is that cannot be; and when that is, God then lives himself in this creature and without her hindering him.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 93. Où l’on parle de la paix de la vie divine

[The author, to the listeners:] The peace of this life, which is divine life, cannot be thought, spoken, or written, so much is the soul in this love without the work of the body, without that of the heart, without that of the spirit: it is through the divine work that it has fulfilled the Law. Reason appreciates well that Madeleine sought Jesus Christ[^1], but Love remains silent about it. Note it well and do not forget it, for she lacked the divine life — which Truth calls glorious life — as long as she sought him. But when she was in the desert, Love possessed her and annihilated her, and that is why Love henceforth did its work in her, for her, without her, and she henceforth lived the divine life which made her possess the glorious life. Henceforth, she found God in herself, without seeking him; and besides, she had no reason to, since Love had possessed her. But before Love possessed her[^2], she sought him by the desire of the will in a way of feeling according to the spirit, and for that reason, she was human and of humble condition, for she was lost, "married," and not Mary[^3]. She did not know, when she sought him, that God is entirely everywhere; otherwise, she would not have sought him. And I have found no one who always knew this, except the Virgin Mary: she never had a will by sensuality nor did any work according to the spirit, but she had only the will of the divinity, which is born of the divine operation. To will only the divine will: that is what was, is, and will be her divine gaze, her divine nourishment, her divine love, her divine peace, her divine praise, all her labor and her rest. And that is why she received, without any intermediary in her soul, the glorious life of the Trinity in a mortal body.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 94. Du langage de la vie divine

[The author, to the listeners:] The language of this life, which is divine life, is the secret silence of divine love. She has come here long ago if she has wanted it for a long time. There is no other life here than always wanting the divine will. Why delay in abandoning yourself? For no one can rest in supreme rest if he is not first exhausted, I am certain of it. Let the Virtues have what belongs to them in you of the sharp will and the heart of your spirit, until they have acquitted you of what you owe to Jesus Christ; this, it is fitting to do, before coming to Life. In the name of God, understand what Jesus Christ himself says: does he not say in the Gospel that "whoever believes in me will do the works that I do, and he will do even greater ones"? Where, I ask you, is the hidden meaning of this word? Until one has paid to Jesus Christ all that one owes him, one cannot find the peace of the land of the divine state where Life dwells. May God quickly give you the fulfillment of your natural perfection, the harmony of the powers of the soul, and satisfaction in all things! This, you must have, for it is the path of divine life, which we call "glorious life." And this state we speak of, which Love, by its goodness, gives us as a model, today brings the soul back to its first day: the one who is brought back today to his first day is the one who acquires on earth through obedience to God, the innocence that Adam lost in the earthly paradise through disobedience. However, the pain remains with him: since Jesus Christ assumes it, it is quite normal that it remains with us. The true innocents are never right and are never wronged; they are completely naked and have nothing to hide: all hide because of Adam's sin, but not those who are annihilated, for they have nothing to hide.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 95. Comment le pays des égarés est éloigné du pays de ceux qui

are annihilated
[The author, to the listeners:] The path is very long from the land of Virtues, which
those who are lost enjoy, to that of the forgotten and the annihilated in
complete destitution, or to that of the glorified in the highest state, where God
is abandoned by himself within himself. He is then neither known, nor loved, nor praised
by these creatures, except only in that he cannot be known, nor loved,
nor praised: such is the sum of all their love and the final stage of their
journey. This final stage leads back to the first, for the intermediate stage does not
turn away from it. Since this soul has completed it, it is right that she rests in
the one who can do all that he wills by the goodness inherent to his divine being; thus she can
do all that she wills, without losing the gifts of the one who
possesses his being inherently. And why not? Her gifts are as great
as the one who gave them, and this gift moves him from himself within himself: he is
Love itself, and Love can do all that it wills; nevertheless, neither Fear, nor
Discernment, nor Reason can say anything against Love.
This soul, according to what she understands, lives in fullness; better: God lives in
her without hindrance on her part, and that is why the Virtues have no reason
to reproach her. Nevertheless, she speaks thus to God:

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 96. Où l’âme parle à la Trinité

**Soul:** Ah! Lord who can do everything! Ah! Master who knows everything! Oh! friends who are worth everything! do everything you want! Dear Father, I can do nothing; dear Son, I know nothing; dear friends, I am worth nothing, and that is why I want nothing. In the name of God, let us never allow anything from ourselves or from others to enter us, for which it would be necessary to make God leave His goodness!

[The author, to the listeners 1:] There was once a creature who begged, and for a long time she sought God in His creature to see if she would find Him there as she wanted, and as He would be Himself if the creature let Him perform His divine works in her without her hindering Him; but she found nothing and remained, on the contrary, hungry for what she pursued. And when she saw that she had found nothing, she began to think; and in thinking, she said to herself that she had to seek Him — and that is how she pursued Him — in the depths of the heart of her understanding, through the purity of her high thought. And that is where this begging creature went to seek Him, and she thought that she would write about God in the way she wanted to find Him in His creatures. And that is how she wrote what you hear, and she wanted her neighbor to find God in her, through her writings and her words; in other words, understand that she wanted her neighbor to be perfectly as she would have discoursed (all those, at least, to whom she wanted to say it!). But in doing, saying, and wanting this, she remained, know this, begging and encumbered by herself; and it is because she wanted to do so, that she begged.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 97. Comment le paradis n’est pas autre chose que de voir Dieu

The very high lady of Peace, she who lives a glorious life, even better: from the very glory that is only in paradise: Certainly, paradise is nothing other than merely seeing God; and that is why the thief was in paradise as soon as his soul left his body; even if Jesus Christ, the Son of God, did not ascend to heaven before the Ascension, he was, himself, on the very day of Good Friday in paradise[^1]. How can this be? It must be so, since Jesus Christ had promised it to him, and it is therefore true that he was there on the very day: it is because he saw God, that he was in paradise and possessed it; for paradise is nothing other than seeing God. And someone is truly there as much and as often as they are unburdened of themselves; and this, not gloriously — for, for this creature, its body is too coarse —, but divinely, for inwardly, it is perfectly delivered from all creatures; and that is why it lives from glory, without intermediary, and it is in paradise without being there.

Seek the hidden meaning of these words, if you want to understand them, otherwise you will misunderstand them; indeed, they will seem somewhat contradictory to those who do not reach the heart of this hidden meaning. But what only seems is not the truth: only it itself is, and nothing else[^2]. But what then was the soul thinking that made this book, wanting one to find God in it to live what it would say about it? It seems that it wanted to take revenge, that is to say, that it wanted creatures to beg from other creatures as it did itself!

**The soul that wrote this book:**
Certainly, it is fitting to do so before one comes in every way to the state of Freedom, I am quite certain of it. And yet, I was so foolish at the time when I made this book, or rather, at the time when Love made it for me at my request, that I was asserting something that could neither be done, nor thought, nor said, just like someone who would want to enclose the sea in their eye, carry the world on the tip of a reed, or illuminate the sun with a lantern or a torch. Yes, I was even more foolish,
When I was asserting what could not be said, And burdening myself with these words to write.

But thus I took my course And came to my rescue At the highest level Of the state we speak of,
Which is in perfection,
when the soul remains in pure annihilation and without thought, and not before.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 98. Raison demande ce que font ceux dont l'état est au-dessus de

their thoughts
**Reason:** In the name of God, what do those whose state is above their thoughts do?
**Love:** They are seized by the one who is at the summit of his mountain, and thus are they seized by that very thing which is at the bottom of their valley[^1], by a nothing-thought enclosed and sealed in the secret enclosure of the highest purity of this excellent soul; this enclosure, no one can open it, nor unseal it, nor close it when it is open, unless the amiable Far-Near, both very far and very near, closes or opens it: he alone has the keys, and no one else carries them nor could carry them.
(To the liberated souls:) And all of you, ladies, to whom God, in his divine goodness, has given this life abundantly and without return — and not only this life of which we speak, but also, with it, the one of whom no one has ever spoken —, you will recognize in this book your exercise. As for the souls who are not such, nor were, nor will be, they will not feel nor recognize this state; it is and will be impossible for them: they are not, know this, of the lineage of which we speak, no more than the angels of the first order are Seraphim nor can be, for God does not give them the state of Seraphim[^2]. And the souls who are not yet such — except already in God, and that is why they will be one day —, they will recognize this state and feel it even more strongly than they have known and felt it, due to the lineage to which they belong and will belong. But the people of whom we speak, who already are such and will be again, they will recognize as soon as they hear it, know this, the lineage to which they belong.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 99. Comment les gens qui sont en cet état sont en souveraineté sur

[The author, to the listeners:] People who are in this state are sovereign over all things. Indeed, the nobility of their spirit is that of the highest angelic order, angels being created according to an ordered hierarchy. These people thus have the dwelling of the highest of all orders in terms of spirit, and the most noble complexion in terms of nature; indeed, they are sanguine or choleric, and not melancholic nor phlegmatic, and thus they have the best share of fortune's gifts, for everything is at their will and at their necessity, for themselves as for their neighbor, without reproaches from Reason. So listen with envy to this great perfection of the annihilated souls of which we speak!

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 100. Comment il y a une grande différence entre les anges

**Love:** It is said, and I say it myself, that there is as great a difference in nature between angels as between men and donkeys! It is easy to believe: divine wisdom has willed it so. And let no one ask why, if he wants to believe it rather than be mistaken, for that is the truth. And everything that could be said about angels among themselves, as you have heard, could be said, in terms of grace, about the difference between the annihilated ones we speak of and all those who are not.

They are very well born, those who are of this lineage; they are royal persons. Their ancestors are of excellent nobility and great destiny, and they could not perform works of little value, nor begin something that does not come to a good end; indeed, these persons are both the humblest they can be and the greatest they must be, as testified by Jesus Christ himself saying that the smallest will be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven[^1]. One must believe it well, but no one will believe it if he is not such: he who is such as what he believes, he truly believes it; but he who believes what he is not, it is because he does not live what he believes; and that one does not truly believe it, for the truth of believing is to be such as what one believes. And he who believes something is he who is such as what he believes: he has nothing more to do, neither with himself, nor with others, nor even with God, no more than if he were not, while he is.

Understand the hidden meaning of this: it is in his will, that what is is for him nothing more than if it were not.

In these three deaths[^2] is accomplished the perfection of this illuminated life[^3]. I call it illuminated in that it surpasses the annihilated life, which is blind: the blind soul supports the feet of the illuminated one, the latter being more noble and more lovable. She knows nothing of anyone, God or man, for she is not; but God knows it of himself, in himself, for herself and by herself. This lady never seeks God: she has no need and has nothing to do with him. He does not lack for her; why then would she seek him? He who seeks is with himself, and thus possesses himself; but thus he lacks something, since he sets out to seek.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 101. Comment cette âme ne veut rien faire, si bien que rien ne lui

**Soul:** By God! Why would I do something that my beloved would not do? He lacks nothing; what then would I lack? Truly, I would be mistaken if I lacked anything, since he lacks nothing: if he lacks nothing, I lack nothing! And this removes the love of myself, so much so that I give myself to him without intermediary and without restraint. I just said that he lacks nothing: what then would I lack? He seeks nothing: what then would I seek? He thinks of nothing: what then would I think?

**The same, annihilated and glorified by lack of self-love:** I will do nothing, Reason, but seek someone who does something; and that, you will do, as I know you! But, thank God, I have no need of you. As for me, I have finished doing anything!

**Reason:** But since when? And at what moment?

**Soul:** Since the moment when Love opened his book to me. Indeed, this book is made in such a way that as soon as Love opens it, the soul knows everything; and thus she has everything, and thus is accomplished in her every work of perfection by the opening of this book. This opening made me see so clearly that it made me return what is his and take back what is mine; that is to say, he is, and that is why he always possesses himself, whereas I am not, and that is why it is only right that I do not possess myself. And the light of the opening of this book made me find what is mine and remain in it; and that is why I do not have so much being that something of him could be in me. Thus the Just One, by justice, has returned to me what is mine, and shown nakedly that I am not; and that is why he wants, by justice, that I do not possess myself: this justice is written in the heart of the Book of Life. This book and I are as it was with God and the creatures when he created them: when he willed it by his divine goodness, all was done instantly by his divine power, and all was ordered at the same moment by his divine wisdom.

[To the listeners:] In the name of God, look at what he did, what he does and what he will do, and you will then find peace, a common peace, a sovereign peace, an absolute peace, itself invaded by such peace that the corruption of your complexion could never be a cause of punishment if you remain in it. My God! How beautiful and great are these words, for those who understand the truth of their hidden meaning!

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 102. Où Entendement-de-l’âme-anéantie montre combien il est

pitiful that malice prevails over goodness
Understanding-of-the-annihilated-soul: By God! Am I not enough in the prison
of corruption where I must be, whether I want it or not, without lodging myself
in that of punishment? My God! What pity when malice prevails over
goodness! And this for the body as well as for the spirit. The spirit is created by God,
and the body is formed by God [^1]; but these two natures, united for corruption
according to nature and according to justice, escape punishment in the waters of
baptism: these two natures are good, due to the divine justice that made them.
But when fault overcomes this complexion and this creation that divine goodness
has made, there is nothing more pitiful, however small the fault may be; we
then cast into bitterness the one who does not want this, and we force him to rage
against us, for there is no small fault: what does not please the divine will, must displease it.
Knowledge of Divine Light: My God! Who then dares to call this small?
I claim that whoever names it "small," was neither well illuminated nor ever will be,
unless he amends himself. But there is something even more serious: he has
disdained the good pleasure of his lord, in this negligence. There would be much
to say about the difference between such a servant and the one who serves his lord in every
way, and in all that he knows might please his will!

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 103. Où l’on montre ce que veut dire que le juste tombe sept fois

by day 1
**Soul:** Some argue from what Scripture says that the righteous fall seven times a day 2. But what fools they would be if they understood this to be in matters subject to punishment! Punishment is for those who fall into a fault by the consent of their will; whereas corruption is due to the coarseness of the complexion of our body. Otherwise, if we had to sin against our will seven times a day, it would seem that we have no free will! This is not the case, thank God! For God would have to not be God for virtue to be taken from me against my will. Indeed, just as God cannot sin, He who cannot will it, I cannot sin without my will willing it: in His love, my beloved has given me this Freedom by His goodness. But if I wanted to sin, why would He not bear it? If He did not bear it, His power would take away my Freedom; but His goodness could not bear that His power takes away my Freedom in any way; in other words, it could not bear that any power takes away my will without my will consenting to it. His goodness has therefore given me, by pure goodness, a free will: in all that He has done for me, He has given me nothing better; the rest, He has lent me by courtesy, and if He takes it back, He does me no wrong; but my will, He has freely given to me, and that is why He cannot reclaim it unless it pleases my will. The master of Love has given me by Love such nobility in His goodness, that never can the Freedom of my will be taken from Him if I do not will it.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 104. Où l’âme dit comment Dieu lui a donné sa volonté libre

**Soul:** See how God has freely given me my free will! I said earlier that He has given me something else as well; but in saying that, one might understand that He has not given me everything, since He has only given me free will, and the other things, He has lent to me. Certainly, that would be a misunderstanding, for He has given me everything and could not have withheld anything without giving it to me, which Love confirms when He says that it would not be the love of the beloved without that. Indeed, by giving me free will out of His pure goodness, He has given me everything as long as my will desires it: He possesses nothing else, I am certain of it.

**Fear:** In the name of God, Madam, in what way has He given you everything?

**Soul:** In that I have freely given Him my will, without any reservation, in complete renunciation, for His goodness and His will alone, just as in His divine goodness, He gave it to me from His divine will for my benefit. Now, I have said that God would not be God if virtue were taken from me against my will. It is true: there is nothing more certain than what God is, and nothing less certain than to claim that virtue could be taken from me without my will desiring it; and that is far from what Scripture says that the just man falls seven times a day into things subject to punishment!

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 105. Ce que veut dire que le juste tombe sept fois par jour

**Truth:** I will tell you what it means that the just man falls seven times a day. It must be understood that, when the will of the just is wholly devoted, without further hindrance, to contemplating divine goodness, the body is weak and prone to faults due to the inheritance of Adam's sin; and that is why it often inclines to desire something lesser than the goodness of God; and this, Scripture calls a "fall," for it truly is one, but the will of the just refrains from consenting to the fault that could arise from this inclination. So much so that this fall where the just man falls due to the aforementioned inclination is more a virtue than a vice for him, because of his will which remains free by refusing any fault, as has been said. Thus you can understand how, from such a height, the just man falls so low, and how this fall, even if it makes him fall very low, is more a virtue than a vice for him.
Now, understand: if the just man falls seven times, it is because he is raised seven times, otherwise he could not fall seven times! He is truly blessed who often falls from such a height, for it means that he comes from where truly no one goes unless he rightfully bears the name of just. And yet, even more blessed is he who always remains there! But no one can be there continually as long as the soul is accompanied in this world by this wicked body; however, this kind of fall does not cause the loss of peace in the reproaches or remorse of conscience, so much so that the soul would no longer live in the peace of the gifts that are given to it above the Virtues — not against the Virtues, but above them. And if this could not be, it would mean that God would be subject to his Virtues, and that the Virtues would be against the soul, they who hold their being from their lord and for his benefit.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 106. Comment l’âme déclare l’ensemble de ses demandes

**Soul:** Now, I will declare all of my requests: in them,
all my petitions would be completely satisfied. Not that I know
how to ask for what I request or would like to request, for the angels of all the
orders and the saints and holy ones who belong to them do not know it: if those
do not know it, the tenth state, which belongs to glory but to none of these
nine orders, would not know how to ask for it either!
**Reason:** But you, Madam, do you know how to ask for something?
**Soul:** But yes, indeed!
**Love:** She may well know it through the divine nature of the attraction of her love,
which forms her requests within her without her knowing it, so that her requests
are foreign to any land where a creature may have knowledge.
**Soul:** What is surprising about that? Why wouldn't there be someone
other than me who knows it and who would thus be within me? That other is
Secret Love, who is beyond all peace[^1], where my love is anchored without myself.
This attraction comes from his goodness to me, which continually renews me
in love. But because he is that of himself, in me and for
me, and because I request it through the attraction of his pure nature without
requesting it from myself, I cannot know anything about it; all those who are in glory
do not do this, but only he who is one God in three persons.
**Love:** But in what she said that she was going to declare all of these
requests, it must be understood that it is he who has what she has who will
declare them; for in truth, what she has, no one other than God can say or
think, he who operates in her continually by his own operation, without
that of the soul and by his divine goodness.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 107. Où commencent les demandes de l’âme 1

[The Author:] The first thing she asks is to always see herself—if indeed she sees anything—where she was when, from nothing, God made everything; and thus, to be certain of being nothing other than that now and always, as far as it depends on her and assuming she never wrongs divine goodness.
The second request is to see what she has done with the free will that God had given her; and she will see thus that she has taken away from God even her will, in a single instant when she consented to sin. It must be understood that God hates all sin, and the one who consents to sin takes away from God His will: it is true, for he then does what God does not want and which is opposed to His divine goodness.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 108. Une belle considération pour éviter le péché

[The Author:] The soul must therefore consider the debt of a single one of its misdeeds, to see how much it owes for two, if it has fallen into them twice.
The Light of the Soul: Twice? Truly, no more than one could count the breaths I take, no more — far less, on the contrary! — could one count the times I have taken away God's will. As long as I had a will, I did nothing but that! Thus my will was lost, until I returned it in complete stripping to the one who had freely given it to me in his goodness. Indeed, he who does good but sees an even greater good that he can do and which is asked of him, if he does not do it, he sins. Therefore, consider what you owe for a single one of your faults, and you will find that you owe God for it as much as his will is worth, you who took it from him by doing your own. To better understand this, consider what God's will is: it is the entire Trinity, which is a single will. Thus, God's will in the Trinity is a single divine nature, and the soul owes all of this to God for a single one of its faults.
We will make a comparison for those who understand in an animalistic way. Suppose that this soul, which is nothingness, is now as rich as God: if it wanted to be free of the debt it owes for a single fault, and pay God no more and no less than what it would owe him then, it would fall back into its nothingness and remain there; and this for having wanted to commit a single fault, and assuming that it is not nothingness by itself and that it has by nature what God has. Thus, even if it were fitting that it reduces itself to nothing according to the law, it would still have nothing left to be free of its fault in strict justice.
And if this can be said of a single sin, what could Truth say if it wanted to speak of the others while adhering to the law? It must nevertheless say it, for it is itself this law, and nothing else but it!
The Soul, responding to itself: Yes, Madam, if you possessed everything this book speaks of, even without giving anything to God, it would still belong to him as a debt and without you being free. — And how much do I owe for the other sins, when no one can count them, except Justice and Truth? — Alas, this debt, I owe it and will owe it endlessly and without discount! Indeed, even before owing anything, I already had nothing, you know and see it; for my will, God gave it to me to do his and thus gain himself by himself... Alas! and I have added to my poverty the great poverty of sin! and of a sin that no one knows, except Truth alone!

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 109. Comment l’âme s’étonne de ne pouvoir suffisamment

**Soul:** My God, my God, my God! Who am I now, when I was already nothing before owing something? Who am I if I was already nothing before owing my God something due to my own will? And while I would still be nothing without being acquitted of a single one of my faults — yes, a single one, no more! — if I had even that which this book says in the comparison you have heard? And that or something else, I neither have it nor can I have it within me! And if I had it, you see where I would be once acquitted of a single sin! Yes, I have never had anything and I can gain nothing by myself, and no one can give me anything to pay my debts. Yes, Truth, who am I? I beg you, tell me!

**Truth:** You are nothingness, and that even before having done me any wrong in what I have given you. You are even other than that, for you are less than nothing, and that as many times as you have wanted something other than my will.

**Soul who has done wrong:** Yes, in all truth, I am nothing else, I know it well, and it is you, Truth, who have taught me this. And there is nothing I know better than this: if God adhered strictly to justice, without mercy for a single one of my sins, I should not suffer less interminable torments than He has power. But if you are, you, Upright Truth, if you are the strict and rigorous justice, there is Indulgence and Mercy, your sweet and courteous sisters, who will defend me before you for all my debts, and in this I find peace. Which among these sisters will come to my aid? It matters little to me: I entrust myself to her with all my will, whether she be Justice or Mercy, Truth or Indulgence. Yes, it matters little to me to fall into either of their two parties; all is the same to me, without joy or worry. And why without joy or worry? Because neither can come from the justice that would be applied to me, nor from the mercy that would be shown to me; thus I have neither joy from one, nor sorrow from the other. Since there is neither gain nor loss for my beloved, all is the same to me from the one who alone is Equality; and this makes me equal too, whereas if it mattered to me, I would be immediately divided, for I would be with myself.

The Son of God the Father is my mirror in this, for God the Father gave us His Son in saving us; and in making us this gift, He considered nothing other than our sole salvation. And the Son redeemed us by dying in obedience to His Father; in doing so, He considered nothing other than the sole will of His Father. As the Son of God is our example, we must follow Him by also considering and wanting in all things the sole divine will: thus we will be sons of God the Father in the example of His Son Jesus Christ.

My God, how sweet it is to consider this will! He has made us capable of it: not that it is impossible for me to sin if I want to, but it is impossible for me to sin if my will does not want it. Thus we are fully capable of fulfilling His will if it remains in us without us seeking it elsewhere: whoever seeks what he possesses, it is due to a lack of knowledge, a failure to possess the art that gives this science.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 110. Comment l’art 1, en la créature, est une habileté subtile, qui

is in the substance of the soul
She who seeks: What then is art in the creature?
**Love:**
It is a subtle skill from which understanding is born, and which gives in
the soul the knowledge by which one comprehends what is said more
perfectly than the one who says it, whatever his understanding of what
he says. This comes from the fact that the one who understands rests, while the one who
speaks works; now, knowledge cannot suffer work without becoming
less noble from it.
This art is agile, and that is why it naturally tends to reach the fullness of what
it undertakes. What it undertakes is the just will of God, neither more
nor less. This subtle skill is the substance of the soul, while
knowledge is its summit, for it is made of substance and understanding.
**[The author:**]
This soul harbors in itself all that makes a life of good morals,
and that is why Love dwells in it and gives it to be so; but it,
it remains in nothingness, and not in love. Indeed, as long as it remains in
love, the soul possesses itself; and as long as it remains there, this love makes it
proud and frivolous: it is because Nature accompanies that love, so much
that there is often in this state something to give and take, which makes the soul
possessive and proud. It then engages in distinct considerations and
meditations, which is proper to the state of contemplation, which retains Thought
near it to help itself. But now that this soul remains in nothingness
because Love remains in it, this state no longer has a hold on it, and for that reason,
nothing in it makes it sad or frivolous, for Thought no longer has lordship over it.
It has lost the use of its senses — not its senses, but their use — for
Love has taken it from the place where it was, leaving them in peace, and thus taken away that
use: such is the fulfillment of its pilgrimage and its return to nothingness by the
restitution of its will when it vanishes in it. This is a capture of
the high seas! for it lives without the will of its will, so much that it is in a
state that surpasses its counsel; otherwise, it would incur the reproaches of the
sovereign who puts this will outside of it, and it would then be at war with
Love — who is the Holy Spirit —, and would incur the reproaches of the Father and the
judgment of the Son.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 111. De la différence entre l’onction de paix et la guerre que fait le

reproach or remorse of conscience
Love: There is indeed a great difference between the anointing of peace, which surpasses all sense
and which remains in the delights of the full satisfaction given by the beloved through the union of love, and this war waged by reproach. He who remains with will often knows this war, whatever good work this will may do; whereas he is at peace, he who remains in non-willing, where he was before possessing the will: divine goodness has nothing to reproach him for.
The liberated soul: My God! How well said! But this, the beloved must do without myself, just as he created me without myself in his divine goodness. Indeed, I am a soul created by him without myself, to perform from him to me the difficult works of Virtues, him for me and me for him, until I am again in him; but I cannot be in him unless he puts me there himself and without myself, just as he made me himself and without myself. He is the Uncreated Goodness who loves the goodness he has created; now, the Uncreated Goodness possesses in itself a free will, and to us too it gives by its goodness a free will external to its power, without any "why", except for ourselves and so that we may be by this goodness. Thus we have a will that emanates from his goodness and is external to his power, so that we may be freer, just as his will is external to our power in its own freedom.
But the divine Goodness saw that we would go in the way of misfortune and perdition because of the free will that God has given us and which emanates from his goodness, goodness which is given to us by goodness; so much so that human nature united with it in the person of the Son, in order to pay for the evil we have committed through the disobedience of our will.
Disobedient will: Also, I can no longer be what I must, until I am again where I was, and as I was before coming out of God as naked as he is, he who is; yes, as naked as I was when I was he who was not. And I must have this if I want to have again what is mine; otherwise, I will not have it.
[The author:] Understand the hidden meaning of this if you will, but especially if you can; if you cannot, it is because you are not there, for if you were there, you would be open to it. If you have the means to listen to this, it is because you are not annihilated to that extent — otherwise, I do not say. And if his goodness has taken away your ability to listen, I do not contradict it.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 112. De la bonté éternelle qui est amour éternel

**[The Author:**] He has an eternal goodness which is eternal love; and it tends, by its nature of charity, to give and spread all its goodness. This eternal goodness engenders a communicable goodness[^1]; from this eternal goodness and this communicable goodness proceeds the intimate love[^2] of the lover in the beloved; and the beloved continually looks at her lover in this intimate love.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 113. Que penser à la passion de Jésus-Christ fait avoir victoire sur

ourselves
[The author:] I make it known to all who will hear this book, that we must
reproduce in ourselves as much as we can—through devout
thoughts, through works of perfection, through the demands of Reason—all the
life that Jesus Christ led and preached to us. He indeed said, as already
mentioned above: "Whoever believes in me will do the very works that I do, and will do
even greater ones1." This, we must do to achieve victory over
ourselves. And if we did it as much as we could, we would come to
possess him while putting outside of us all thoughts, all works of
perfection, and all the demands of Reason, for we would have no need of them: the
divinity would then operate in us, for ourselves and without ourselves, its
divine works. God is what he is; that is why he is what he is by himself:
lover, beloved, love.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 114. Si la créature humaine peut demeurer en vie tout en étant sans

[The Author:] I ask the blind, or those who are illuminated[^1] and who see better than them, if the human creature can remain alive while being without itself. If those do not tell me, no one will tell me, for no one knows it unless they are of this lineage. Truth, for her part, answers yes; and Love emphasizes it by saying that the annihilated soul is without itself when it no longer feels in any way either nature, or its operation, or any inner work, nor shame, nor honor, nor any fear of anything that happens, nor any affection towards divine goodness, when it harbors no will at all, but rather is perpetually without will: it is then annihilated, without itself, whatever God may endure from it; it then does everything without itself, and thus leaves everything without itself. This is not surprising: it is no longer for itself, for it lives from divine substance.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 116. Comment l’âme se réjouit de l’épreuve de son prochain

[The author:] This soul sees in her beloved a complete and perfect love; thus she seeks no occasion to have his help, but rather takes his interests as her own. She sometimes rejoices unknowingly in her higher part, whether she wills it or not, in the trials of her neighbor, for she sees in her spirit and knows without her knowing that this is the way by which he will reach the harbor of his salvation.

This soul sees her own light at the sublime point where the union is made, and thus she delights in the pleasure of the one to whom she is united; indeed, his pleasures are the salvation of creatures. She is united to the will of her beloved, and for that reason she finds her joy in his goodness, due to the accord by which his goodness has thus united her to him unbeknownst to Reason. But thereby, Reason now perceives her joy, and tells her that it is a sin to rejoice in the trial of her neighbor: Reason always judges according to what she knows, for she always wants to do the work that belongs to her; but here, she is one-eyed and cannot see high enough, and that is why she thus complains to the soul. Yes, Reason is one-eyed, it cannot be denied, for no one can see the elevated things if he is not to be eternal; thus, in all justice, Reason cannot see this, for her being must disappear.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 117. Comment cette âme montre qu’elle est l’exemple du salut de

every creature
The most high Spirit, who is no longer under the dominion of Reason[^1]: But
now, God has nowhere else to place His goodness, except in me; He has nowhere else
to properly shelter and He cannot find where to place Himself entirely,
except in me; and in this, I am an example of salvation, and not only an example,
but, moreover, the very salvation of every creature and the glory of God. I will
tell you how, why, and in what way: it is because I am the sum of
all evils!
Indeed, I contain by my very nature[^2] what is evil, and I am therefore
all malice; whereas he who is the sum of all goods, contains within himself—
and by his very nature—all goodness, and he is therefore all goodness. Thus, I am
all malice and he, he is all goodness. Now, it is to the poorest that one must give
alms, under penalty of depriving him of what is rightfully his; and God cannot
be unjust without denying Himself. Thus, His goodness is myself, due to my
necessity and the justice of His pure goodness: since I am all malice and He
is all goodness, I must have all His goodness so that my
malice may be absorbed! My poverty cannot be satisfied with less! And His goodness could not
bear that I should beg, since it is powerful and strong; whereas I
would necessarily have to beg if He did not give me all His goodness, for I am all
malice; and nothing less than the fullness of the abundance of all His goodness can
fill the abyss of my own malice. By this means, I therefore receive within myself
all His divine goodness, from His pure goodness and by goodness; I have received it without
beginning and I will receive it without end, for He has always known this necessity, and in
this, I have always received it in the knowledge of His divine wisdom, by the will of
His pure divine goodness and by the operation of His divine power. Otherwise, if
He had not always acted thus towards me, I would no longer exist. And it is in this
that I say that I am the salvation of every creature and the glory of God: just as
Christ, by His death, is the redemption of the multitude and the praise of God the Father,
I am, due to my malice, the salvation of humankind and the glory of God the
Father[^3]. Indeed, God the Father has given all His goodness to His Son, and this goodness of
God is made known to humankind in the death of His Son Jesus
Christ, who is eternally the praise of the Father and the redemption of the human
creature.
**Soul:**
I tell you likewise that God the Father has poured into me all His
goodness, and that He has given it to me. This goodness of God is made known to humankind through
malice; hence it is clearly apparent that I am
eternally the praise of God and the salvation of the human creature, for the salvation
of every creature is nothing other than the knowledge of the goodness of God:
since all will have through me the knowledge of the goodness of God who grants me this
goodness, it will therefore be known to them through me, and it would never have been known if it were not
for my malice. Since divine goodness is known to them through my malice, and their
salvation is nothing other than knowing divine goodness, I am therefore
the cause of the salvation of every creature in that the goodness of God is known to them through
me; and since the goodness of God is known through me, I am His sole glory and
His sole praise, for His glory and His praise are nothing other than the
knowledge of His goodness: our salvation and all His will consist in nothing
else, indeed, than in knowing His divine goodness, of which I am the cause, since
the goodness of His pure nature is known through the malice of my cruel nature, and
I have no other reason to possess His goodness than my own malice.
Nor can I ever lose His goodness, for I cannot lose my malice; and
this point has assured me without any doubt of His pure goodness. And the mere nature of my
malice has thus adorned me with this gift, and not any work of goodness that I might have
ever done or that anyone could have done: none of this gives me comfort
or hope, but only my malice, for it is through it that I hold this
certainty.
Thus you have seen—and you can see if there is in you even a bit of
light—how, in what way, and why I am the salvation of every creature and the
glory of God. And since I receive all His goodness, I am therefore that very thing which He
is by transformation of love, for the stronger transforms the weaker into himself.
This transformation is rich with many delights: they know it, those who have
tried it! But if the pupil of the eye is the most fragile thing—
it fears the slightest foreign body, whether it be fire, iron, or stone, which
would be its death—divine love is even more vulnerable to anything that can be opposed to it when one does not always adhere to the fullness of its
pure will.
You can now understand how my malice is the cause of receiving His
goodness on the occasion of the necessity I have for it. Indeed, God sometimes
allows some evil to be accomplished for a greater good that must be born
afterwards, and all those who are created by the Father and come into this world, have
descended from perfection to imperfection to reach the greatest
perfection: there is opened the wound that will heal those who were unknowingly
wounded[^4]. These people have humbled themselves and they have borne the cross of Jesus
Christ in the work of goodness by which they bear their own.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 118. Des sept états de l’âme dévote, que l’on appelle aussi « êtres1

**Soul:** I promised, as soon as Love had cast its hold, to say something about the seven states that we call "beings," for they are seven. These are the steps by which one ascends from the valley to the summit of the mountain so isolated that one sees only God there, and each step is established in a particular state.

**[Author:**] The first state, or step, is that the soul touched by God through grace and stripped of its power to sin, has the intention to keep, at the cost of its very life—even if it means dying—the commandments that God gives in the Law. For this reason, this soul looks and considers with great respect that God has commanded it to love Him with all its heart, and its neighbor as itself. This seems to it to be quite a task compared to what it can do, and it seems to it that if it were to live a thousand years, its power would be enough only to hold and keep the commandments.

**Free Soul:** At this point and in this state, I once found myself for a time. But no one fears reaching the summit if their heart is generous and inwardly filled with noble courage; only a petty heart does not dare undertake great things nor climb higher, for lack of love: this is cowardice, and it is not surprising among people who remain in such laziness that does not allow them to seek God; indeed, they will never find Him if they do not seek Him diligently.

**[Author:**] The second state, or step, is that the soul considers what God advises His intimate friends, beyond what He commands; for one is not a friend who can deviate from doing all that he knows pleases his friend. Thus, the creature abandons itself and strives to act above all human counsel, in works that mortify nature, in the disdain of riches, delights, and honors, to perfectly fulfill the counsels of the Gospel, of which Jesus Christ is the model. Thus, it fears neither the loss of what it has, nor the words of people, nor the weakness of the body, for its beloved did not fear them, and the soul invaded by him cannot fear them either.

The third state is that the soul considers itself in the affection of love for the work of perfection, where its spirit decides, through a bubbling desire of love, to multiply these works within itself; this is done through the subtle knowledge of the understanding of its love, which can offer its beloved nothing else to comfort him but what he loves. Indeed, nothing has value in love except to give the beloved the most loved thing.

Now, the will of this creature loves only works of goodness, through the difficulty of its great undertakings in all the labors with which it can feed its spirit. Hence, it seems to it, rightly, that it loves only works of goodness; and for that reason, it can give nothing to Love if it does not make a sacrifice of it; indeed, no death would be a martyrdom to it, except that which consists in abstaining from the work it loves, that is, the delights of its good pleasure and the life according to the will that feeds on it. And that is why it abandons such works where it finds such great delights, and puts to death the will that took life in them; and it obliges itself, to be a martyr, to obey the will of others by abstaining from work and will, and by fulfilling the will of others to destroy its own will. And this is more difficult, much more difficult, than the two aforementioned states, for it is more difficult to overcome the works of the will of the spirit than to overcome the will of the body or to do the will of the spirit. Thus, one must crush oneself, by breaking and shattering oneself, and thus enlarge the place where Love will want to dwell; and one must burden oneself with several states to unburden oneself and to reach one's state.

The fourth state is that the soul is absorbed by the elevation of love in the delights of thought through meditation, and that it is detached from all external labors and obedience to others through the elevation of contemplation; this makes the soul so fragile, so noble, and so delightful, that it cannot bear anything to touch it except the pure delight of Love, which it enjoys with singular grace. This touch makes it proud in the abundance of love, for it is the master of it thanks to the brilliance, that is, the clarity, of its soul which marvelously fills it with love, in great faith and by the concord of the union that has put it in possession of its delights.

The soul then claims that there is no higher life than to possess this, of which it has lordship; indeed, Love has so greatly satisfied it with its delights, that it does not believe that God can make a greater gift to a soul here below than this love that Love has spread in it out of love.

Yes, it is not surprising that this soul is invaded, for Gracious Love completely intoxicates it, so much so that it lets it understand nothing else but him, because of the strength with which Love delights it. And for that reason, the soul cannot appreciate another state; indeed, the great clarity of Love has so dazzled its sight that it lets it see nothing beyond its love. But there, it is mistaken, for there are two other states that God gives here below, and which are greater and nobler than this one; but Love has deceived many souls because of the sweetness of the enjoyment of its love, which invades the soul as soon as it approaches it! And no one can oppose this force: the soul knows this, which, through fine love, has exalted Love beyond itself.

The fifth state is that the soul considers that God is, He who is and from whom all things derive their being, and that it itself is not and is therefore not that from which all things derive their being. And these two considerations give it a wondrous astonishment: it sees that He is all goodness, He who has placed a free will in it which is not, except as entire malice.

Now that divine goodness has placed in the soul a free will by pure divine goodness, what is not—except as malice and which is therefore entirely malice—contains within itself the free will of the being of God, of Him who is the Being and who wants what has no being to have being in this gift that He gives it. And that is why divine goodness spreads before it, by the movement of divine light, an overflow that ravishes the soul. This movement of divine light, spread as light within the soul, shows its will the equality of soul of what is and gives it the knowledge of what is not, to remove it from the place where it is and where it should not be, and to place it where it is not and from where it came, where it should be.

Now, this Will sees, through the light of the overflow of divine light (light which is given to this Will to place it back in God, for it cannot return there without it), that it cannot benefit itself if it does not separate from its own will; indeed, its nature is bad, due to the inclination that leads it to nothingness, and the will has reduced it to less than nothing. Thus, the soul sees this inclination and this perdition of the nothingness of its nature and its own will, and thus it sees in the light that its Will must will the sole divine will, and no other, and that this is why this Will was given to it. And that is why the soul withdraws from its own will, and the Will withdraws from this soul to place itself back in God, to give and surrender itself to Him where it was taken from the beginning, without retaining anything of itself, in order to fulfill the perfect divine will; this cannot be accomplished in the soul without this gift, unless it is either at war or in failure; and this gift operates in it this perfection and thus transforms it into the nature of Love, which delights it with a perfect peace and satisfies it with divine nourishment. For that reason, it no longer guards against warring in its nature, for its will is placed back stripped where it was taken and where it should be by justice; whereas it was always at war as long as it retained the Will outside of its being.

Now, this soul is therefore "nothing," for it sees through the abundance of divine knowledge its nothingness which makes it null and reduces it to nothing. And thus it is entirely, for it sees through the depth of the knowledge of its malice, which is so deep and so great that it finds neither beginning, nor measure, nor end, but an abyssal and bottomless abyss; it is there that it finds itself without finding itself and without encountering a bottom. Indeed, it is not found, that which cannot be reached; and the more it sees itself in this knowledge of its malice, the more it knows in truth that it cannot know it, not even the smallest point that makes this soul an abyss of malice, a gulf where it shelters and spreads, like sin in the flood, which contained all perdition. This is how this soul sees itself without seeing it. But who makes it see itself? It is the depth of Humility, which places it on the throne and reigns without pride: there, pride cannot penetrate, since it sees itself without seeing itself. And this non-seeing makes it see itself perfectly.

Now, this soul is established at the bottom, where there is no bottom, which makes it so low; and this abasement makes it see very clearly the true sun of the highest goodness, for it has nothing that prevents it from seeing it. This divine goodness shows itself to it through the goodness that absorbs it, transforms it, and unites it by union of goodness in the pure divine goodness, of which Goodness is the master. And the knowledge of the two natures we have spoken of, namely of divine goodness and its malice, is the science that has endowed it with this goodness. And because the Bridegroom of its youth wants only one thing, He who is one, Mercy has made peace with firm Justice by having transformed this soul into its goodness. Thus, it is both entirely and not at all, for its beloved makes it one.

Now, this soul has fallen from love into nothingness, a nothingness without which it cannot be entirely. This fall is so deep, if it has fallen well, that the soul cannot rise from such an abyss; it should not do so, but rather remain there: it is there that the soul loses its pride and its youth, for its spirit is now an old man who no longer leaves it to enjoyment and frivolity. Indeed, the Will has withdrawn from it, which often made it, through the feeling of love, proud, arrogant, and possessive in the elevation of the contemplation of the fourth state. But the fifth state has brought it to the point by showing it to itself. Now, it sees by itself and knows divine goodness, knowledge that makes it see itself in return; and these two visions take away from it the will, the desire, and the work of goodness, so that it is entirely at rest and placed in possession of a state of Freedom that rests it from all things in excellent nobility.

The sixth state is that the soul does not see itself, whatever abyss of humility it has within it, nor does it see God, whatever very high goodness is His. But God then sees Himself in it, through His divine majesty which illuminates this soul with Himself, so that it sees nothing that can be outside of God Himself, He who is and from whom all things derive their being. What is, is God Himself, and for that reason, it sees nothing but itself, for who sees what is, sees only God Himself seeing Himself in this soul itself through His divine majesty. Then the soul is in the sixth state, freed from all things, pure and illuminated—but not glorified, for glorification is in the seventh state; we will possess it in glory and no one can speak of it. However, this soul thus pure and enlightened sees neither God nor itself, but God sees Himself through Himself in it, for it, without it. And God shows it that there is nothing that can be outside of Him. That is why it knows only Him, so that it loves only Him and praises only Him, for there is nothing that can be outside of Him. Indeed, what is, is by His goodness; and God loves His goodness, wherever He has given it by goodness; and His given goodness is God Himself, and God cannot withdraw from His goodness without it remaining with Him; that is why what is, is goodness, and goodness is what God is. And for that reason, Goodness sees itself through its goodness in the divine light of the sixth state where the soul is illuminated. Thus, there is nothing that is outside of Him who is and who sees Himself in this being through His divine majesty, in the transformation of love of the goodness spread and placed back in Him. And for that reason, He sees Himself through Himself in this creature without giving it anything of its own: everything is proper to it and is itself proper.

Such is the sixth state that we had promised to tell the listeners as soon as Love had cast its hold; and Love has of itself paid this debt in its high nobility.

As for the seventh state, Love keeps it within itself to give it to us in eternal glory: we will not have knowledge of it until our soul has left our body.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 119. Comment l’âme qui a fait écrire ce livre s’excuse de l’avoir

seems long in words, while it appears short and brief to the souls who
dwell in nothingness and who have come to this state through love.
**Soul who wrote this book:** Yes, ladies, you who are known in nothing,
you who are in being without separating from the Being in nothing known, truly, you
are known in nothing! But this holds in the land where Reason has lordship. I
apologize to all of you who dwell in nothingness and who have arrived at this state through
love, for I have made this book quite long in words, while it seems very small to you, as far as I can know you. Please
excuse me, by your courtesy, for necessity makes law. I did not know to whom to declare
what I could understand; but now, I acknowledge, for your peace and
for the truth, that it is very low! It is Cowardice that led it, she who has
rendered understanding to Reason through Love's answers to its questions, so
that it has been made according to human science and human wisdom, while
human reason and human wisdom know nothing of inner love, nor
does inner love know anything of divine science: my heart is absorbed so high
and engulfed so low that I cannot reach it, for all that one can say, write, and
think — which is more than saying — about God, is rather lying than telling
the truth.
I said that Love made this be written by human science and in wanting the
transformation of my understanding, for I was burdened by it, as is
apparent from this book; indeed, Love did it by unburdening my mind in the
three gifts that we have mentioned. And that is why I declare that it is very low and
very small, however great it seemed to me when I began to show this
state.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 120. Comment Vérité fait l’éloge de ces âmes

Truth, praising the souls who are in this state[^1]:
O emerald, precious stone,
True diamond, queen, empress,
You give everything in your fine nobility, Without asking Love for his
riches,
But only the will of his divine pleasure. This is quite just,
For it is the true path
Of Pure Love, to desire to stay on it.
O very deep well and well-sealed source, Where the sun is subtly hidden,
You cast your rays through divine science;
This, we know through true wisdom,
For it is its brilliance that always makes us shine.

**Soul:**
O Truth, in the name of God,
Do not say that of myself,
I never say of him,
Anything that is not given by him;
And it is quite true, do not doubt it,
For never, in this, have I had a mistress.
If you please to know to whom I belong,
I will say it out of pure courtesy:
Love, at such a point, has taken me under his tutelage, That I have neither sense, nor will,
Nor reason to do anything,
If not, know this, by him alone.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 121. Où Sainte-Eglise fait l’éloge de cette âme

**Holy Church:**
Courteous and well-instructed, that is well said! You are the true star, who
indicates the day,
The pure sun without blemish, without trace of impurity,
The full moon, never hiding; You are the oriflamme, who
precedes the king.
You live on the single grain, without further will, While those who live on straw, on
bran, on coarse fodder 1, Are those whose human will still exercises:
They are serfs of the Law; she is above the Law, But not against the Law: Truth
bears witness.
She is full and sated: God is at her will.

**The Soul:**
Yes, very dear divine Love, who are in Trinity,
Such is my happiness, that I marvel at how they can endure
Those whom Reason governs, and Fear, Desire, Work, and Will,
Without knowing the great nobility of remaining silent.

**The Holy Trinity:**
O stone come from heaven,
I beg you, dear daughter: why worry about it?
There is no great scholar in the world who could speak to you about it;
You were at my table, I gave you my food; Thus you are well-instructed,
and you savor my food well,
My wines from the full vat, with which you are so filled, That just by smelling them, you
have become intoxicated; And you will never change again.
You have thus tasted my food And savored the new wine:
No one but you could speak of it;
Thus you could not, whatever price they offer you,
Devote your heart to another exercise.
If it pleases you, my dear daughter,
My sister, my beloved,
I beg you by love:
Do not wish to reveal The secrets you know;
Others would be damned Where you will be saved,
Since Reason and Desire govern them,
And Fear, and Will.
But know this, my chosen daughter:
Paradise is given to them.

**The Chosen Soul:**
Paradise? Do you not grant it to them otherwise? The
murderers will also have it, if they want to cry for mercy! But I do not want to be
silent just because you wish it, and that is why I will recite the verses
of a song 2 with the permission of Fine Love.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 122. Où l’âme commence sa chanson

**Soul:** See the ascent into the heights, the most precious entry and the worthy
abode that the sweet humanity of the Son of God our Savior gives to the human
creature, humanity that divinity has established in high possession of paradise, up
there, at the right hand of God the Father, united for us with the Son: for all this, yes,
be amazed! Give him thanks and gratitude, for on that day too, he gave me
Perfect Love. And this, thanks to whom? Thanks to myself, to my neighbor, and to
the whole world, thanks to spiritual affection and to the Virtues of which I had been a slave
by my submission to the power of Reason. I will tell you the truth about it here:
Given the foolishness in which I remained In that time when I served them,
Surely I could not
Express it to you with all my heart!
And while I served them,
While I preferred them,
Here is the joy that Love gave me:
I heard someone speak of it!
And as simple as I was,
Even if I esteemed it poorly,
Love made me want to love it.
And when Love saw me thinking of him because of the Virtues, he did not refuse me,
but rather he withdrew me from their humble service to lead me to
the divine school, and there he kept me without any service, and there I was satisfied
and fulfilled.
Thinking is worth nothing here,
Nor working, nor speaking.
Love draws me so high — Thinking is worth nothing here —
By his divine glances,
That I have no desire.
Thinking is worth nothing here Nor working, nor speaking.
Love has made me, in his nobility,
Find the verses of my song.
It sings of pure divinity Of which Reason cannot speak,
And my only beloved:
He has no mother,
But he comes from God the Father,
And also from God the Son.
His name is the Holy Spirit:
My heart is so united with him,
That he makes me live in joy.
The beloved, in that he loves me,
Gives me his nourishment here.
I do not want to ask him for anything,
For that would be great malice.
I must rather fully trust
In this love of my lover.
O beloved, with your amiable nature,
There is much to praise you for!
Generous and courteous without measure,
Summit of all goodness,
You no longer want to do anything,
Beloved, without my will.
So I must not keep silent
About your beauty, your goodness:
You are powerful and wise for me;
That, I cannot hide.
Alas, alas! But to whom then shall I say it?
Even a Seraphim cannot speak of it!
O beloved, you have possessed me in your love,
To give me your great treasure,
Which is to give yourself,
You, the divine goodness.
And if the heart cannot say it,
A pure not-wanting-to knows it,
He who has made me rise so high,
By a union of heart to heart
That I must never reveal.
I was once confined in the slavery of a prison,
When Desire locked me in a want of affection.
There the light of the ardor of divine love found me;
It immediately killed my desire, my will, and my affection,
Which prevented me from being taken to the heart of divine love.
And the divine light brought me out of prison:
Its nobility united me to the divine will of Love,
There where the Trinity gives me the delights of its love.
This gift, no man knows it,
As long as he serves one or another Virtue,
That he feels through Nature or exercises in Reason.
O beloved, what will the beguines, the religious people say,
Hearing the excellence of your divine song?
The beguines declare that I am lost,
And the priests too, the clerics and the preachers,
The Augustinians, the canons and the friars minor!
For the state of which I speak, it is perfect love,
Without saving their Reason which makes them say that.
Desire, Will, and Fear certainly take away from them the knowledge,
The richness and the union of the high light
Of the ardor of divine love.
Truth declares it to my heart:
I am loved by one alone.
She says that it is without return
That he has given me his love.
This gift kills my thought
Of the delights of his love,
Delights that exalt and transform me by union
Into the eternal joy of being in divine Love.
Divine Love tells me that he has entered into me,
So well that he can do all that he wants:
The strength he has given me,
It is from the beloved that I hold in love;
To him I am devoted,
And he wants me to love him,
So well that I will love him.
I said: I will love him;
I lie, I am not there!
He alone loves me:
He is, I am not!
And nothing else matters to me,
Except all that he wants,
Except all that he is worth.
He is in fullness:
I receive fullness from him;
This is the divine heart
And our loyal loves.
EXPLICIT
HERE FOLLOW SOME CONSIDERATIONS FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN THE STATE OF
THE LOST AND WHO ASK FOR THE WAY TO THE LAND OF FREEDOM
1.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 123. La première considération porte sur les apôtres

I want to state some considerations for the lost who ask for the way to the land of Freedom, considerations that did me much good at the time when I was among the lost, when I lived on milk and porridge and still acted foolishly. These considerations helped me to endure and bear the time when I was off the path, and they then served me to find this path; indeed, it is by asking that one can go far, it is by asking that one finds one's way and finds it again if one has strayed from it.

I first asked my thought why Jesus Christ said this to his apostles: "I must go away, and if I do not go away, truly you cannot receive the Holy Spirit[^1]." And I then received an answer from Justice, who told me that Jesus Christ said this to them because they loved him too tenderly according to human nature, and too weakly according to his divine nature. That is why he said: "I must go away." It was hard for them to hear, but through this hardness, they could see their love and see that it was natural and not divine. The truth of what they heard was neither hard nor strange to them, but they were troubled according to their understanding; and it is quite right, for they were also coarse according to love. Nevertheless, they still possessed the sweet grace of God, for that love does not separate from the grace of God — it is rather in his grace that one possesses it — but it prevents the gifts of the Holy Spirit[^2], for they can suffer nothing but pure divine love, without any mixture of nature.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 124. La seconde considération porte sur la Madeleine1

Then, I considered the gentle Madeleine, and what service was hers at the coming of Jesus Christ her guest. He often came to Mary's house for the great familiarity she had with him and his apostles; but it was not for nothing that he came there, for Mary did not move, whatever task there was to do at that time. And supposing that Our Lord Jesus Christ often returned with very heavy legs, his blessed head all tired, supposing he was completely fasting, all weary and rejected by everyone—he indeed found no one to give him drink and food—and that Madeleine knew all this, nevertheless, whatever was lacking to his body, she did not move and relied on her sister Martha to serve him, whose duty it was; but to love him, she relied only on herself!

I also considered Mary when she sought Our Lord Jesus Christ at the tomb; she did not find him there, but found two angels who spoke to her offering to comfort her. But Mary received no comfort from them, no more than if the shadows of the two angels had offered themselves to her: Mary sought the true sun who created the angels, and that is why she could not receive comfort from the angels!

My God! Mary, to be such in seeking and loving humanly with the affection of a tenderness invaded by your spirit, what a beloved you must have been when you sought nothing more, but were placed in divine love without the affection of your spirit!

After that, I considered how Mary cultivated the land that her lord had given her: she sowed pure wheat there; this wheat united with this cultivation, and the master then made it bear fruit a hundredfold; but this was not before Mary had done what she could and should do.

And when she had done what she could and should towards God who asked it of her, and who for this purpose had created her by himself but for her, then Mary rested without making any work of herself; and God did his work gently in Mary, for Mary, without Mary. Indeed, Mary had done what was her part, and the rest no longer depended on her, but on the master who had given her this land to till.

Now, I will speak for the children—and not for the wise—about how this was done.

When a man owns land and necessity invites him to find his sustenance there, he plows it, cultivates it, and weeds it in the way he thinks it will yield better, so that it bears the wheat that must be sown there and that the one who plows and sows may live from it. These two things must necessarily be done before the man can reap the fruit of his land for his sustenance. But when the wise farmer has cultivated his land, weeded it, and sown it with wheat, all his power can do nothing more; he must rather let God take care of everything if he wants to enjoy his work, for by himself, he can do nothing more: natural wisdom shows you this. Now the wheat must rot in the ground before it can yield any new fruit from which the farmer can receive help, whatever his work has been. How this grain rots, how it is reborn bearing fruit a hundredfold in great multiplication, no one knows, except God who operates it alone after the farmer has done what is his, but not before.

In truth, I tell you the same about Mary. The land that Mary worked was her body, which she put to the test in the impetuous and marvelous operations of her ardent desires: they made it run over her land, plowing it with works of goodness; it was through them that she worked in all that she knew her land could better bear the true seed of God's grace. Indeed, a single good work does not engender virtues, but many works truly ensure them, and perfect works produce them; that is why Mary needed many works for the virtues to be perfect in her.

Now, you have heard how Mary worked by her plowing the land that God had given her to cultivate. So I will speak to you about the pure wheat that Mary sowed in her plowing. In reality, it is the pure intention she directed to God, for it would be too much for the work to be bad and bear no fruit if the intention is truly for the love of God. She had this intention in all she did, for her affection was always in God for the love of whom she plowed and sowed the land he had given her to work.

This work, she received it because of the fault of sin, so that through it, the great irregularities that were in her might be smoothed out. Now, you might ask how it is possible that a good work done with right intention can be in the soul because of the fault of sin; it was not always and everywhere the case: if this work was in Jesus Christ, it was for the fault of humankind, whereas if it is in us, it is truly because of our fault, even if the blind call this life true perfection, and it is named thus for those who do not see and could not truly understand it. But those who have two eyes call it "fault of sin," and undoubtedly it is so, for just as the child must have in him and do the works of the child before being a perfect man, similarly must the man act foolishly and madly in his human works before possessing the true heart of the state of Freedom, a state where the soul operates in a divine exercise and without its own operation.

And this divine exercise prevents and restrains us from working in ourselves certainly by our fault, in good works as in bad.

So you have just heard that the good work is a fault of sin; I will now tell you why: it is because the lesser takes the place of the greater, and because of our fault, the lesser establishes itself at its convenience, and this lesser makes us lose the noble divine state. Indeed, because we have in us good works, which is the lesser, we cannot at the same time have the noble divine state, for they cannot dwell together: this one is too great to bear a foreign guest in its company. But Mary had to have this lesser because of the fault you have heard: she had this good work so ardently, she took it on so much and burdened herself with it so strongly, that this burden truly unburdened her of herself.

Thus Mary plowed and sowed her land: the plowing is the hard works of perfection; and the seed is the pure intention. These two works, we owe them because of our fault, but our work cannot penetrate further, and that is why God must do the rest; and so he does, this is clearly evident in Mary. Indeed, after her work, when she had done what belonged to her, she was unburdened of herself, so much so that God had to do the rest, without her, for her, in her: since she had done what she had to do and what belonged to her, she let God dispose entirely of her. And we should do the same. Now, how her work benefited in her and through her, and how Mary found life in what she received the fruit a hundredfold in great multiplication, no one knows, except God who operates this multiplication alone. This work, he did for Mary in her desert when she rested from him, and not when she ran after him by herself; he did it when divine goodness rested in Mary and rested Mary from him, without Mary and for Mary, and Mary then lived from the new fruit that came by the sole operation of God. So she did this plowing, took on the work and the seed, but not the fruit: this is how Mary reached the fullness of her state, not by speaking and seeking, but by being silent and sitting.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 125. La troisième considération porte sur saint Jean-Baptiste

Then, I considered the greatest of the saints, that is to say, the very dear John the Baptist, he who, although sanctified from his mother's womb, did not concern himself with it. And I considered with astonishment that he had pointed out Jesus Christ to his disciples so that they would follow him, while he himself remained silent[^1]. And it is not found that Saint John left the desert to go see Jesus Christ in his human nature: he was content with his state, without seeking him; and divine goodness did its works in him and satisfied him without imposing on him to seek his humanity.

And after that, I considered to what extent, when Jesus Christ went to see him in the desert, he refrained from retaining him in his human person or accompanying him. Then, I considered him when he preached about Our Lord Jesus Christ[^2]; it is said that he sat and took an interest in the sermon of the very dear John the Baptist, but John the Baptist did not relax his attention, no more than he did before, so much did divinity occupy his mind.

Then, I considered him when he baptized Jesus Christ[^3]; in doing so, he touched God the Son, while hearing the voice of the Father and seeing the Holy Spirit. To whom did he show him? To whom did he hide him? Did he become proud? Not at all! He only cared about pleasing the one who did this work in his goodness.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 126. La quatrième considération porte sur la Vierge Marie

Then, I considered the sweet Virgin Mary, she who was so perfectly sanctified[^1]; to whom did she show it? To whom did she reveal it? To whom did she hide it? To no one! She did not care about such a great work, and it did not matter to her.
Next, I considered her in her vow of virginity: even if the whole world had to be saved, I claim that she would never have consented with a single thought to leave the state of virginity, since in His goodness, Jesus Christ could do that through His death.
Next, I considered her when she conceived the Son of God, Jesus Christ, by the virtue of the Holy Spirit[^2]. I claim that in truth, she had at that moment more knowledge, more love, and more praise of the divine Trinity than all those, except her, who are in glory. And why not, Madam? I claim that the good John the Baptist — who is next to you, Madam, like a stickleback next to a whale! — was more perfectly filled with divine light from his mother's womb than the twelve apostles were on the day of Pentecost, when they received the gifts of the Holy Spirit in abundance; then you, chosen lady, needed all of that! For I claim that the Son of God, if He had found in you the slightest vanity, even if it were in vain and without necessity the fold of the little miller[^3] (which is a worm), He would never have made you His mother. But, Madam, it was not possible for you to be that, and therefore it was not possible for you not to be His mother.
Next, I considered this lady at the cross, in the presence of her child's death, when the Jews crucified Him completely naked before her face. Alas! What pity! Who knew better than this lady the righteousness of Jesus Christ? Did she not know well that He was being killed unjustly? And was she not a mother in knowing it? But, Madam, what harm did your thought wish upon them for that? Did you say anything to them, Madam, out of cruelty? What did you do to them in your actions, Madam, for the crime they committed? In truth, Madam, if it had been necessary, you would have given your life at that very moment, rather than God not forgive them this misdeed! But it was not necessary, for Jesus Christ was performing this reconciliation so abundantly and so painfully that it sufficed for everything. Why so abundantly? When as little of His blessed blood as could be held on the tip of a needle would have sufficed to redeem a hundred thousand worlds if they had existed, He gave it in such great abundance that none remained; and this consideration made me lose myself, so that He would make me live by the divine good pleasure. I also said that He performed this reconciliation very painfully; why so painfully? I claim that if all the evils of death and other torments, all those that have been, that are, or that will be from the time of Adam to the time of the Antichrist, if all these evils were gathered, in truth, it would still only be the pain of a prick, compared to the pain that Jesus Christ would have endured from a single prick of a dart or a punch made to His precious and venerable body, and that because of His delicacy, His fineness, His tenderness, and His purity.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 127. La cinquième considération porte sur l’union de la nature

divine to human nature in the person of the Son
After that, I considered how the divine nature united for us with the
human nature in the person of God the Son. Great God! Who then
could imagine that enough? Who then would have had the boldness to dare ask and
demand it, if His goodness itself had not accomplished it? That Jesus Christ was
poor, despised, and tormented for us, that is not surprising: He could not refrain from it, given the excess of Love with which He loved us; and in His humanity, that was
possible. But that the divine nature takes on human nature by uniting with it
in the person of the Son, who then would have dared to ask for such an excess? There is
enough there to think about to be forever unburdened from ourselves, if
we would only let justice operate within us. Alas! Why did I not
let it do its work? If I had let it do what it pleased, it
would have freed me the very moment it gave me this thought about Him; but I
did not want it to repair in me the ugliness of my loss. My thoughts have
led me through many follies: I thought to find it through my works, and I do
nothing and will do nothing but lose it.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 128. La sixième considération porte sur les tourments de

the humanity of the Son of God for us
After that, I considered how He who was God and man was shamefully despised for me on earth; and I also considered the great poverty into which He placed Himself for me, and the cruel death He suffered for me.
In these three things and in these three points are comprised and incomprised all His actions[^1]. O Truth, Way, and Life[^2]! What shall we then think of You?
Thinking of a single one of Your benefits for us inflames our hearts with Your love more than the fire of the whole world, of heaven and earth, would inflame to destroy a single corporeal thing!
And I then considered the purity of Truth; it told me that I would not see the divine Trinity until my soul was as free from the stains of sin as that of Jesus Christ, which was glorified at the very moment it was created by the divine Trinity, and united to a mortal body and a divine nature in the person of the Son: at the moment it was created and united to these two natures, it was as perfect as it is now. It could not have been otherwise: since His soul was united to the divine nature, His body, being mortal, could not have been any hindrance to it.
I then asked myself who would ascend to heaven. And Truth told me that no one would ascend there, except He who descended from there, namely the Son of God Himself[^3]. In other words, no one can ascend there, except those who are sons of God by divine grace. And that is why Jesus Christ Himself says that "he is my brother, my sister, and my mother, who does the will of God my Father[^4]."

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 129. La septième considération porte sur les Séraphins : comment

they are united to the divine will
I then considered the Seraphim, and I asked them about the
works that Charity performed through the mystery of the incarnation of the humanity of Jesus
Christ, about their creation by the divine Trinity, and about all that
Charity would eternally do in creatures in its goodness for them. But
Love told me that none of this mattered to them, except for one thing: the
divine will of the divine will of the entire Trinity. And this is a
sweet and profitable consideration, which frees one from oneself to
approach the state where one ought to be.
Thus we have seven considerations that are well-suited for the lost; the
first concerns the apostles, the second concerns Magdalene, the third concerns the
Baptist, the fourth concerns the Virgin Mary, the fifth concerns the union of the
divine nature with the human nature in the person of the Son, the sixth consideration
concerns the torments of the humanity of the Son of God for us, and the seventh
concerns the Seraphim and their union with the divine will.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 130. Où l’âme parle de trois belles considérations et réflexions

… how she knows of divine power, wisdom, and goodness only what she knows of her own weakness, foolishness, and wickedness.

I will now speak to you about the considerations I made in the life I just mentioned, that is, in the misguided life, at the time when I did not know how to bear and contain myself.

I began by considering myself, then I considered God and I considered myself as if I wanted great things for Him; and I praised and rejoiced in these three things more than all others, and these considerations gave me the way to bear and contain myself.

I considered and first said this: "Lord God, I do not know where You are from, for that, only Your more than eternal power grasps. Lord, I do not know what You are, for that, it is Your more than eternal wisdom that knows. Lord, I do not know who You are, for that, only Your divine and more than eternal goodness grasps."

And in the same way, I spoke thus of myself: "I do not know where I am from: that, it is Your power that grasps. I do not know what I am: that, it is Your wisdom that knows. I do not know who I am: that, it is Your goodness that grasps."

And I then spoke thus: "Lord, I do not know where You are from because I know nothing of Your more than eternal power. I do not know what You are because I know nothing of Your more than eternal wisdom. I do not know who You are because I know nothing of Your more than eternal goodness." And similarly of myself: "Lord, I do not know where I am from because I know nothing of my extreme weakness. Lord, I do not know what I am because I know nothing of my extreme foolishness. Lord, I do not know who I am because I know nothing of my extreme wickedness.

"Lord, You are a goodness spread by goodness and entirely in Yourself; but I am a wickedness spread by wickedness and entirely in myself.

"Lord, You are, and therefore all things are accomplished by You, and nothing is done without You; but I am not, and therefore all things are done without me, and nothing is done by me.

"Lord, You are all power, all wisdom, and all goodness, without beginning, without measure, and without end; but I am all weakness, all foolishness, and all wickedness, without beginning, without measure, and without end.

"Lord, You are one God in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; but I am one enemy in three wickednesses, that is to say, weakness, foolishness, and wickedness.

"Lord, how much can I grasp of Your power, of Your wisdom, and of Your goodness? As much as I can grasp of my weakness, of my foolishness, and of my wickedness!

"Lord, how much can I grasp of my weakness, of my foolishness, and of my wickedness? As much as I can grasp of Your power, of Your wisdom, and of Your goodness! And if I could grasp one of these two natures, I would understand them both; for if I could grasp Your goodness, I would grasp my wickedness; and if I could grasp my wickedness, I would grasp Your goodness: it is the measure of it. And because I know nothing of my wickedness beside what it is, I know nothing of Your goodness beside what it is. But the little I know of Your goodness, Lord, it is the knowledge I have of my wickedness that gives it to me. And the little I know of my wickedness, Lord, it is the knowledge I have of Your goodness that gives it to me. And in truth, Lord, it is still so little, that one can say it is nothing rather than something, compared to what remains! And that is why You are everything: Your Truth gives You that in me, and that is how I know it."

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 131. Où l’âme dit qu’elle ne veut que la volonté de Dieu

After that, I considered in my malice and in his goodness what I could do to appease him, and I set myself in meditation making suppositions and having my will consent without restraint. Thus I said to myself that, if it could be that I had never existed, so that I had never wronged his will, if such was his good pleasure, that would be my good pleasure.

I then told him that, if it could be that I had existed from the time he did, and that I had been without failure, and that I had since then endured as much poverty, contempt, and torment as there is in him of goodness, wisdom, and power, provided that I had never wronged his will, if such was his good pleasure, that would be my good pleasure.

Then again, I said to myself that if it could be that I return to nothingness, just as I come from nothingness, so that he would be avenged of me, if such was his good pleasure, that would be my good pleasure.

And again, I said to myself that if I had by myself everything that he has by himself, so that nothing could be taken from me or diminished without my will, I would pour all that into him and return to nothingness, rather than be able or willing to retain anything that did not come from him; and even more, for if it could be that I could have endlessly what I have just said, I could not nor would not do otherwise.

Moreover, I said to myself this: if everything I have just said — that is to say, having by myself everything that he has by himself — belonged to my own condition, I would rather that everything go to nothingness without restraint, rather than have something that did not come from him; and if I received from him as many torments as he has power, I would still prefer those torments received from him over the eternal glory that I would receive from myself.

Then, I said to myself in my meditation, that, rather than do anything henceforth that would be against his good pleasure, I would rather that the humanity of Jesus Christ suffer again as many torments as it has suffered for me, if it could be that I do something that would displease him.

Then, I said to myself that, if I knew — and that it be the truth — that everything he created from nothing, whether it be myself or something else — that is to say everything —, should go to nothingness if I did not wrong his will, everything I have just said would go to nothingness, rather than I wrong him or wish to wrong him.

Then, I said to myself that, if I knew that I should receive endlessly as many torments as he has goodness unless I go against his will, I would suffer them eternally rather than do something that I knew could displease his will.

And then after, I told him that, if it could be that he could and would give me all the goodness that he has eternally, I would still love it only for him; and that if I lost this gift, I would only care for it for him; and that if he gave it back to me after this loss, I would only take it back for him. And if it could be that it pleased him that I go to nothingness and that I no longer have the slightest being, and not that I receive that gift from him, I would prefer that, rather than retain it. And if it could be that I had in my power what he has in his power, and that I had it as well as he does and without lacking anything unless I wanted to, but knowing that it would please him more that I receive from him as many torments as he has goodness in him, then I would prefer that rather than retain it.

And even more, I said to myself that if I knew it was possible that the sweet humanity of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the entire court of heaven could not bear that I receive these eternal torments without regaining the state from which I would have fallen; and if I knew that God had put in them — if it were possible — this pity and this will, and that he told me: "If you want, I will give you back what you have lost by my will, and I will take you out of these torments because my friends want it, those who are in my court; but if it were not their will, I would not give it back to you and you would be in eternal torments, for it is for their love that I give you this gift if you want to accept it"; if I knew all this, I would fail endlessly and remain in the torments, rather than accept this gift that I would not receive from his sole will, and that even assuming it is through the prayers of the humanity of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the saints, that I could regain it. Indeed, I could not bear it if I did not receive it from the pure love that he himself has for me in his pure goodness, and from his sole will of beloved towards his beloved.

And after that, I supposed that he asked me how I would behave if I knew that it could please him more that I love another than him; but there, sense failed me and I did not know what to answer, nor what to want, nor what to reply, and I answered that I would take counsel.

And after that, he asked me how I would behave if it could be that he could love another more than me. There again, sense failed me and I did not know what to answer, nor what to want, nor what to reply.

And even more, he asked me what I would do and how I would behave if it could be that he could want another to love me more than him. And similarly, sense failed me and I did not know what to answer, no more than before, but I continued to say that I would take counsel; that is what I did, but it is to him that I asked for counsel! And I told him that these three things were very difficult compared to the previous ones. And I asked him, my mind all astonished, how it could be that I love another more than him and that he loves another more than me, or that another loves me more than him. And there, I failed, for I could not answer any of these three things, nor deny them, nor reply anything to them. And yet, he kept coming back to get my answer; but I was so at ease and I loved myself so much being with him, that I could not contain myself at all nor find the means: I felt held closely, and that is why I advanced with an unsteady step. This, no one knows unless they have gone through it. And yet, I could not have peace until he had my answer. But I loved myself so much being with him, that I could not answer lightly, whereas if I had not loved being with him, my answer would have been brief and light! And yet, I had to answer if I did not want to lose both myself and him, and that plunged my heart into great distress.

Now, I will tell you, this answer: I told him that he wanted to test me on all points. — Alas! what am I saying? Certainly, I did not say a word! It is my heart alone that fought this battle, and it answered in the anguish of death that it wanted to withdraw from his love, from which it had lived and from which it thought it should live longer. — But since it was that by supposition he could want that, and since one must want all his will, here is what I answered him:

(Answer to the three aforementioned questions:) "Lord, if it were possible that the things mentioned above should be eternally in the reality of facts as they are in that of questions, I will say for you what I would want from you for the love of you: if I had that same thing that you have with the creation that you have given me, so that I am equal to you, Lord, except in that I could change my will for that of another — which you do not do —, since you would unconditionally want the three things that have been so hard for me to bear and grant, if I knew without doubt that your will wants it without diminishing your divine goodness, then, I would want it, without ever wanting anything else. And in saying this, Lord, my will comes to an end: my will is martyr, and martyr is my love, for you have led them to martyrdom and their thought can do no more. My heart once thought to live endlessly in love by the desire of a good will; but now, these two things in me are finished, which have made me leave my childhood."

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 132. Comment Justice, Miséricorde et Amour viennent vers

when the soul has emerged from its childhood
Then appeared the Land of Freedom, and Justice came to me; and she asked me
what favor I wanted from her. And I replied that, as I was, I
wanted no favor, neither from her nor from anything that could torment me.
Then came Mercy, and she asked me what help I wanted from her. And
I replied immediately that, as I was, I no longer wanted any help, neither from her nor
from anything that could do me good. Then, Love came to me,
full of kindness, he who so many times had driven me out of my senses and had
finally given me death — you have heard something about it! — and he said to me:
**Love:**
"Beloved, what do you want from me?
I contain all that was, that is, and that will be;
I am filled with all of that:
Take from me whatever you please;
If you want all of me, I do not oppose it.
Tell me, beloved, what do you want from me?
I am Love and am filled with all kindness:
What you want, we want it.
Tell us, beloved, simply your will."
But I replied immediately that I was pure nothingness. Alas! What would I want? Pure
nothingness never had a will! I want nothing: nothing matters to me from
the kindness of Love; everything that comes from it matters not to me at all! That he be truly
filled with it, that he be and that nothing be except through him: I have said that this
has completely satisfied me, and thus it suffices me.
I then began to emerge from childhood, and my spirit began to age
when my will was dead and my works were completed, as well as my
love which made me frivolous. Indeed, the invasion of divine love, which
showed itself to me by divine light in a very high and brilliant flash, showed me
all at once both itself and myself; it was very high, and I was
so low that I could not then rise from it nor help myself; and from there came
what I have of the best. If you do not understand this, I cannot do better:
this work is a miracle about which nothing can be told to you without lying.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 133. Où l’âme dit que les considérations susdites sont pour les

lost, and she shows again who the lost are, and how these
considerations are made in the life according to the spirit.
**Soul:** You have thus heard certain considerations that I made to unburden myself and find my way. I contemplated this while I was lost, that is to say, when I was troubled[^1]; indeed, the lost are all those who have some affection of spirit, and these considerations are made in the life according to the spirit and by the affection of tenderness of the love that the soul bears for itself. But it thinks that it is to God that it bears this love with which it is so strongly affected, whereas, in truth, it is itself that it loves, unknowingly and without realizing it. And there, those who love according to the tenderness of their affection are deceived, for it does not let them come to knowledge. And that is why they remain like children, with the works of a child, and they will remain so as long as they have spiritual affection.
**Divine Love, who rests of itself in the annihilated soul:** My God! How long the path is, how great the distance from this lost life to the liberated life of which Nothing-wanting is lord! And this Nothing-wanting sows the divine seed taken from the divine will. This seed can never fail, but few people are disposed to receive it. I have found many people who have perished in the affection of the spirit, by the works of the Virtues and in the desires of a good will; but I have found few who are nobly lost; and surely, I have found even fewer who are free, that is to say, who lead a liberated life and who are as this book demands by having the sole will that Pure Love makes one have. Indeed, Pure Love makes one have a unique love and a unique will, and that is why my will has become a unique nothing-wanting. And this Love is only refinement in that it is of the divine work.
This soul is naked, but it does not fear, in this nakedness, that the serpent will bite it[^2]. And since God cannot increase His own joy, that of this soul cannot similarly withdraw nor grow by its own work; God would have to do it by His own. If its joy were to withdraw by the soul's work, it would be because it was there for itself; whereas if it is naked, that cannot be. And since its goodness cannot diminish, evil cannot grow in it by its own work; and if it does not make it grow by its own work, it is because then it would be there for itself; whereas if it is naked, that cannot be.
**Free Soul:** It is true; in this respect, I am myself in perfectly abandoning myself, for miracles[^3] are due to Faith and give me the true knowledge of divine gifts: Faith is the cause of it.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 134. Comment l’âme est parfaite en son état lorsque Sainte-

The Church cannot take example from her life
**Love:** This soul is in the most perfect state, and closest to the Far-Near,
when Holy Church does not take example from her life: she is then below
the work of Humility, so much so that she is beyond the work of Poverty and
above the work of Charity; she is so far from the work of Virtues, that she
could not understand their language, while the works of Virtues are all
contained within her and they obey her without opposition. But due to this
closure, Holy Church cannot know her:
Holy Church praises the fear of God, for the holy fear of God is one of the
gifts of the Holy Spirit; and yet, it would destroy the state of Freedom if it could
penetrate it.
Perfect Freedom knows no "why [^1]". At the point of the sword, the soul
has put to death the pleasures of the body and killed the desires of the spirit. She has placed
all her love under her feet, and she cares no more for it than if it did not exist:
what surpasses her [^2] has freed her from the debts she owed to Jesus Christ, and
that is why [^3] she owes him nothing, whatever her debt may have been: what surpasses
her shows her how he acquitted her of what does not surpass her. But that
which surpasses her, she wants to possess it fully within herself and without any
intermediary. And the great sense of Nature, by which the misguided let themselves be guided
in affection of spiritual life in a struggle against themselves, removes this
abyss from them; that is to say, they cannot understand the nakedness of this abyss, nor
feel in its breadth the goodness of God for them. And that is why they remain
with the works.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 135. Comment sont trompés ceux à qui il suffit de se gouverner en

the affection of life according to the spirit
Oh how mistaken they are, those who are content with that! Indeed, all that the
creature can do as works of goodness is nothing compared to divine wisdom; and yet, divine goodness does not give its goodness to the soul except because of this very goodness, and a single appearance of this more than eternal goodness is worth more than all that the creature can do in a hundred thousand years, or even than what the entire holy Church can do. And the remoteness of this goodness is in reality a proximity for this soul, for it knows within itself this Far-Near in that it continuously places it in the union of its will, without disgust for anything that might happen to it: everything is equal to it, without any "why," and it itself is nothing in this equality; thus it has nothing to do with God, no more than God has to do with it. Why? Because He is, while it is not; and in its nothingness, it needs nothing more, for it suffices that He is and that it is not. It is then stripped of all things, for it is without being where it was before it was. And thus it receives from God what it has, and it is what God is in the transformation by which Love transforms it and leads it back to where it was before it came from the goodness of God.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 136. Comment toute œuvre est défendue à l’âme anéantie

There, she does not pray more than she prayed before she was one. She receives what she has from divine goodness, from the heart of her love, from that noble Far-Near. She does not worry about anything, for what she loves the most is also what she detests the most: such is her way; there is no more, no middle, or less in her love, and that is why she is not saddened by anything that happens to her. She is of a bottomless depth, and thus she has no proper place; and if she has no proper place, she also has no self-love. Every word, every work is forbidden to her in the simple being of divinity, as was once prescribed by Jesus Christ, Son of God. She is at the point where she has no matter to do good; whence it follows that she also has no matter to do evil, for Love gives her everything and acquits her with her neighbor. "It is just," she says, "that everything be subject to me: since everything was made for me, I receive everything as mine, without prohibition. And why not? You have loved me, you love me, and you will love me with all your power as Father, with all your wisdom as Brother, with all your goodness as Beloved; and never were you, dear Father, dear Brother, dear and Beloved, even for a moment, without me being thus loved by you: I can therefore well say that you love no one more than me! For just as your goodness could not suffer that your humanity, that she who engendered it, that the angels and that the saints do not receive the glory of your eternal goodness, it could not also suffer that I receive the pain and torments of which I am worthy; and thus I constantly receive your mercy to the very measure of your power in all that I should endure."

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 137. Comment cette âme est professe en sa religion, et comment

she has well kept the rule
This soul is professed in its religion, and it has completely satisfied its rule.
What is this rule? It is to be brought back by annihilation to the state
where Love received it at the beginning. It has indeed passed its probation exam,
and it has won the wars that opposed it to all its powers.
But the one we just spoke of was too strong for it; and it is not
surprising, for there is no graver war than a war waged against
its friends: the one who kills them must pass through the edge of the sword. And there, the power
of the soul is taken away without compensation, but there also all its infirmity is healed.
Oh! What pity that massacre of the friends of the soul who helped it to conquer its
enemies, but who ultimately put them all to death! How can one be surprised? God
accomplishes his blessings in his own way, and that is why this soul no longer wants
to remain in this place. Its thoughts were once insolent in putting it in the
place of God, but that was because it was out of its proper state.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 138. Comment l’âme retourne à son premier état 1

Thus, the state of this soul is now that of its original state, which is its proper state; thus it has left three and united two into one. But when does this unique state exist? This unique state exists when the soul is restored to the simple divinity: it is a simple state of overflowing fruition, in a total knowledge, without feeling and above thought. This simple state operates in the soul by Charity all that it operates, for its will has become simple, and this simple will has no act in itself; and this since it has overcome the necessity of the two natures, when the will was given to the soul for this simple state. And this simple will — which is divine will — puts the soul in the divine state: none can rise higher, nor descend lower, nor be more annihilated in humanity. He who wishes to understand this, let him beware of the traps of Nature! For as subtly as the sun absorbs the water from a cloth without anyone, even by looking at it, noticing it, similarly Nature deceives itself without knowing it if it is not on guard thanks to a very great experience.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 139. Comment Nature est subtile en bien des points

My God! How subtle Nature is in many ways, when she demands under the guise of goodness and under the pretense of necessity that to which she has no right! Yes, what she demands is often dangerous! For with all her tricks, she often receives what is not hers by stealing it herself, through her strength, her vigor, or her amiability. I experienced this to my great misfortune, or rather to my great fortune, when I unknowingly neglected to do what I should according to divine knowledge[^1]. This divine knowledge and this rest barred my way to my country, hiding the truth from me[^2] where I should have taken Humility to know mine. And yet, I lost in this what was mine and what I possessed, but which was never mine!

It may well happen that one does not find in a kingdom two creatures who are of the same mind; but if by chance these two creatures find each other, they will open up to each other without being able to hide; and even if they wanted to hide, they could not, due to the condition of their mind and their complexion, and due to the kind of life to which they are called, whether they like it or not. These people have a great need to be on their guard, if they have not reached the summit and the perfection of Freedom! And that is why, if God has given you his high creation, his excellent light, and his particular love, I tell you this in conclusion: be fruitful and increase this creation without failing in it[^3], for his two eyes are constantly watching you; and if you consider and look at this properly, this gaze makes the soul simple.

Deo gratias

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 71. Comment cette âme n'œuvre plus pour Dieu, ni pour elle-

even, nor for his neighbor
Love: This soul no longer works for God, nor for itself, nor for its neighbor, as has been said; but let God work in its place, if He wills, He who can do it! And if He does not will it, this soul cares no more for one than the other: it is always in the same state. Henceforth, the ray of divine knowledge is in this soul; it absorbs it out of itself without itself, in a divine and astonishing peace, struck by an elevation of abundant love from the most-high Jealous One, who gives it everywhere the freedom of a master.
The soul: Jealous? Yes, jealous, He truly is! He shows it in His works which have entirely stripped me of myself and placed me without myself at the divine good pleasure. And this accomplished union of peace joins me and conjoins with me by the sovereign elevation of the creation prepared by the divine being, He from whom I hold my being, for He is the Being.
Love: When this soul is thus absorbed by Him without itself, absorbed by God and for itself, it is a divine operation; and never was there a work of charity done by a human body, that has reached such an operation, or that could have reached it.
The soul: Understand well the two words of Love, for they are difficult to understand for those who do not have the intelligence of their hidden meaning.
Love: It is true, for the work of a creature (understand: the work done by man) cannot be compared to the divine operation, to that which God does in a creature by His goodness for it.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 72. Où l’on parle de la distance qui sépare le pays de ceux qui ont

perished or have gone astray, from the land of freedom; why the soul retains its
will
**Soul:** Understand correctly the two words of Love, for they are
foreign to the land of the lost and belong to that of freedom and accomplished peace,
a land where those who are there dwell.
**Love:** It is true, I will tell them a word.
**Soul:** Yes indeed, despite Will, in whom those who have perished and those who
are lost dwell, they who thus lead their life of perfection.
**Love:** When the divine Trinity created the angels by the courtesy of its divine goodness,
the wicked agreed by their perverse choice to the evil will of
Lucifer, who wanted to possess by his own nature what he could only have
by divine grace. And as soon as they wanted this by their disobedient will,
they lost the state of goodness. They are now in hell without this
state, and without ever recovering by mercy the vision of God. And this
high vision, their will made them lose it; whereas they would have kept it by
giving this will, instead of retaining it. And see to what extremity they have
come!
**Truth:** Alas, alas! Why, souls, do you love your will so much, since it
is the occasion of such a great loss?
**Love:** I will tell you why the soul retains its will: it is because
it still lives according to the spirit, and in a life according to the spirit, there is still will.
**Reason:** My God! Lord Love, tell me why, since the beginning
of this book, you have called "soul" this chosen soul that you love so much;
while you say that the lost persons retain their will because
they still live a life according to the spirit, why have you so often
called it by a name as humble as that of "soul," which is lesser than that of
"spirit"?
**Love:** Good question! Indeed, to understand well, all those who live a
life of grace by fulfilling the commandments and accepting to find
their satisfaction in it, truly bear the name of "soul"; not that of
"spirit," but that of "soul" because of their life of grace. Indeed, all the
hierarchies of paradise do not bear one and the same name, which would allow them to be
designated by their highest name; if all are angels, the first angel did not
receive the name of Seraphim, but only that of angel, while the
Seraphim bear both. Understand what this means without saying it.
Indeed, I have similarly told you that those who keep the commandments and to
whom that suffices, receive the name of "soul" and not that of "spirit"; their proper
name is "soul" and not "spirit" because these people are far from the life
according to the spirit.
**Reason:** And when then is this soul entirely spirit?
**Love:** It is when the body is entirely put to death and the will
rejoices in shame, poverty, and tribulation: it is then entirely
spirit, but not otherwise; then these spiritual creatures know the purity
of conscience, the peace of affections, and the intelligence of reason.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 73. Comment il faut que l’esprit meure pour perdre sa volonté

**Reason:** In the name of God, sire Love, I beg you to tell me why the spirit must die to lose its will.

**Love:** It is because the spirit is full of spiritual will, and no one can live a divine life as long as he has will, nor find satisfaction if he has not lost his will. Now, the spirit is not perfectly dead until it has lost the feeling of its love, and the will that gave it life is not dead either; and in this loss, the will reaches its fullness in the satisfaction of divine pleasure; and in this death grows the higher life, which is always either free or glorious[^1].

**Truth:** In the name of God, sire Divine Love, I beg you to show me a soul perfect in this state.

**Love:** Willingly, and if it is not as I will tell you, I recommend you to take it back and tell it that it is ill-disposed and unprepared to speak to me in my secret chamber, where no one enters unless they are disposed as you will hear me say[^2]. I have no other beloved than the one who fears neither loss nor gain, except only for my good pleasure; for otherwise, she would seek her own interest and not mine, rather than be with me; whereas this my spouse cannot seek her own interest. If she had committed as many sins as the whole world has ever committed, and done as much good as all those who are in paradise, and if all this good and all this evil appeared to the entire people, this soul would feel neither shame nor honor for herself, and she would neither want to hide nor conceal her evil; and if she did otherwise, she would seek her own interest and not mine, rather than be with me. What shame do those in my paradise feel, even if their sins and the gifts of glory they receive from me are seen? Certainly, they do not want to hide their sins at all, they do not feel shame that they are known, nor to show my glory.

**Truth:** But certainly not! They let the master decide who hides or shows them at his will. And the souls we speak of do the same, they who are vessels of this election: the Far-Near represents this noble gift to them.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 74. Pourquoi Amour appelle cette âme par un nom aussi humble que

**Love:** Now, Reason, you ask me why I have given this soul such a humble name as that of "soul." Reason, it is because of your coarseness that I have so often called her by her nickname! And because one understands the hidden meaning of something through a nickname, I have used it, and I will do so again; but her true name is of perfect nobility: she bears the name of "pure," "celestial," and "Spouse of Peace." Indeed, she reigns at the bottom of the valley from where she sees the summit of the mountain and from where she sees the mountain from the summit: no one can penetrate between the two[^1]; the wise man secures his treasure there, that is to say, the gift of the divine love of unity; and this unity gives her peace and the subtle and marvelous nourishment of the glorious land where her beloved dwells. She no longer feeds on what she possesses, but on the glorious life[^2]. This nourishment is that of my chosen spouse who is Mary-of-Peace; and she is Mary-of-Peace because Perfect Love feeds her[^3]. Martha, know this, is too troubled and does not know it; her troubles disturb her, which makes her far from such a life.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 75. Comment l’âme illuminée fait comprendre les choses

by the example of the transfiguration of Jesus Christ
Understanding of Divine Light: Well then! You who have reason to
hide, tell me now, by Love, what you understand in this.
The illuminated soul: What I understand, I will tell you.
The souls who have reason to hide: We understand that Jesus Christ
was transfigured on Mount Tabor, where there were only three of his disciples.
1. And he told them not to speak of it and to say nothing until he was
resurrected.
The free soul, to the slaves of Nature, who, for that matter, hide: Well said!
You give me the stick with which I will defeat you! So, I ask you:
why did God do this?
The soul that hides: He did it because of us. And since he teaches us,
why should we not do the same? 2
The [free] soul: Ah! Poor sheep! How animal-like your understanding is!
You leave the grain and take the straw! I tell you: when Jesus Christ
was transfigured before three of his disciples, he did it so that you would know
that few people would see the glory of his transfiguration, and that he shows it
only to his intimate friends; that is why there were only three. And this still happens
in this world when God gives himself in the ardor of his light to the heart
of the creature.
Now that you know why there were three disciples, I will tell you
why it was on the mountain: it was to show and signify that no one can
see divine things as long as they mingle and occupy themselves with temporal things,
that is to say, things lesser than God. And I will tell you why
God told them not to speak of it until he was resurrected: it was to
show that you cannot say a word of divine secrets as long
as you could take vain glory from it; until then, no one should speak of it.
Indeed, I assure you, as much as he who has something to conceal or
to hide, has something to show, as much as he who has nothing to show, has nothing to
hide.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 76. Où l’on montre qu’à l’exemple de la Madeleine et des

saints, the soul feels no confusion for its sins
**Soul:** My God, yes! Look at the repentant sinner: she felt
no confusion that Jesus Christ told her she had chosen the
better and more secure part, and, moreover, that it would never be taken from her.
And she felt no confusion either that her sins
were known to all the people, with the testimony of the Gospel itself saying that in
the sight of all, God cast out seven enemies from her. She felt no confusion towards
anyone, except towards those she had wronged; indeed, she was
overwhelmed, enraptured, and possessed, and that is why she cared for no one,
except for him[^1].
And what was the confusion of Saint Peter, when God raised the dead in
his shadow? And yet he had denied him three times(a)! Certainly, he felt no
confusion, but rather it brought him great honor.
What was the confusion or the glory of Saint John the Evangelist, when God made
the true Apocalypse through him? And yet he had fled at
the arrest of Jesus Christ[1]!
**Soul:** I claim that neither he nor the others felt either confusion, or honor, or
any desire to hide or conceal themselves; and that they did not care
about what God did through them, for themselves or for the
people, even if it was a divine work.
These examples are more than sufficient for those who can understand, so that they
understand what remains to be said, and this book is not written for others.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 77. Où l’âme demande si Dieu a mis une fin et un terme aux dons

of his goodness
**Soul:** I said, as you can see above, that they had neither shame nor honor for what God did for them, nor any desire to hide it from anyone.
**Truth:** But, surely, they would not have known why! For they were unburdened of themselves and entirely in God.
**Soul:** But, in the name of God, since He granted them this grace, does He not still do the same now? Would His generosity in giving no longer be what it was? Would He have then put an end and a limit to the gifts of His goodness?
**Courtesy:** Certainly not! His divine goodness could not bear it. For Him to make the great gifts He wishes to give as He did in the past, and to give what has never even been given nor spoken by any mouth and thought by any heart, it is only necessary to want and know how to prepare oneself for it.
Understand, by Love — Love implores you — that Love has so much to give and places so little limit on it, that He unites two things into one in an instant.
**Soul:** But there is one thing I am pleased to say, not for those who are thus disposed, for they have no need of it, but for those who are not and who will be one day (and those have some need of it!): that they be on their guard, so that, if Love asks them for something of what He has lent them, they do not refuse it, whatever the result may be, at any hour and whatever Virtue Love sends to be the messenger. Indeed, as messengers, the Virtues carry the will of Love in letters sealed by their lord, as do the angels of the third hierarchy.
And all those to whom Love sends His messengers, let them also know that, if they then refuse what the Virtues ask from within — which must have lordship over the body — they will never make peace with the sovereign who sent them, but they will be taken back and troubled in their knowledge, and burdened with themselves due to lack of trust. Indeed, Love says that it is in great need that one recognizes a friend.
**Reason:** Here, answer me: if he does not help him in need, when then will he help him? Tell me then.
**Love:** And if I do not remember, what is so wonderful about that? I must keep the peace of my divine justice and render to each what is his; not what is not his, but what is.
[To the soul:] Now, understand the hidden meaning of this book. Indeed, a thing is worth as much as it is appreciated and needed, and no more. Now, when I wanted to need you (I say "need" to the extent that I ask it of you) and it pleased me, you refused me in several of my messengers; this, no one knows, except me, and me alone. I sent you the Thrones to take you back and give you orders, the Cherubim to illuminate you, and the Seraphim to set you ablaze. Through all my messengers, I instructed you of my will and the states in which I asked you to be — and they made it known to you — but you still did not take it into account.
Seeing this, I left you to your own guardianship to save yourself; whereas if you had obeyed me, you would have been different, by your own testimony. Yes, you will indeed save yourself, but it will be in a life burdened with your own spirit, and it will never be entirely unburdened, for you did not obey my messengers nor the Virtues when I wanted through them to unburden your body and free your spirit; and because you did not obey when I instructed you through the subtle Virtues I sent you and through my angels with whom I pursued you, I cannot rightfully give you the Freedom that I have, for Justice cannot do that. Yes, while I was instructing you, if you had obeyed the will of the Virtues I sent you and my messengers with whom I pursued you, you would have rightfully had the Freedom that is mine. Ah! Madam, how burdened you are with yourself!
**Soul:** It is true, my body is full of weakness, and my soul is full of fear, for I am often anxious according to these two natures, whether one likes it or not, whereas free persons are not and cannot be.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 78. Comment ceux qui n’ont pas obéi aux enseignements de

remain encumbered by themselves until death
**Love:**
Yes, exhausted soul, you have much trouble and little gain! And all this for not having obeyed the teachings of perfection with which I pursued you to unburden you in the flower of your youth; nevertheless, you never wanted to change, and you wanted nothing to do with it. You have rather always rejected the requests I made known to you through messengers as noble as those you have just heard about.
[To the listeners:]
These people remain encumbered by themselves until death. But surely, if they had wanted, they would have been delivered from what they are and will be in very great servitude for a small profit... If they had wanted, they would have been delivered for little. Yes, truly, it would have sufficed that they give themselves where I wanted them, and I showed it to them through the Virtues whose office it is.
I said that they would have been absolutely free in soul and body if they had followed my advice expressed by my Virtues, but they refused my will and what they had to do, rather than I penetrate them with my Freedom. And because they did not do what they had to do, they have entirely remained as you hear it said, and encumbered by themselves. Those who are free, annihilated, and adorned with delights know it well, and they see for themselves the slavery of others. Indeed, the true sun shines in their light, so much so that they see the dust in the sunbeam thanks to the brilliance of the sun and its ray. And when this sun is in the soul with these rays and these gleams, the body no longer experiences weakness nor the soul fear, for the true Sun of Justice has never healed a soul without healing the body when performing miracles on earth; and he still often does so now, but not for those who do not put faith in it.
Thus you can see and hear that he is great, strong, very free, and unburdened of all things, who trusts in God, for then God sanctifies him.
I have just spoken of those whom I pursued from within to obey the perfection of the Virtues and who did nothing about it, that they will remain encumbered by themselves until death; I add this: if they strove every day to achieve the perfection of the apostles by applying their will, they would not be unburdened of themselves — let no one expect it! —, neither in body nor in soul. No; and better yet: since harshness and inner pursuits do not lead to this, there is nothing more to be done. Indeed, everything one does with oneself is all encumbered by oneself: let them know it, all those who undertake to work with themselves without the ardor of inner effervescence.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 79. Comment l’âme libre conseille de ne point s'opposer à ce que

the good spirit asks
the free soul: If I tell all those who train for the perfect life to be on
their guard, it is so that they do not refuse what the ardor of the desire
of the will of the spirit demands, however dear it may be to them to reach what is best and
which follows this life, the one that is called "wandering life" and "life according to the spirit."
Love: I said they should be on their guard, because they need it if they
want to come to what is best and reach it; this life here is
domestic and servile, and it prepares the hotel to host at its coming a state
as great as the freedom of wanting nothing, a state in which the soul will be in every way
satisfied, I mean: satisfied with this nothing that gives everything. Indeed, he who
gives everything possesses everything, and no one else.
the soul: Yes, but I would like to say this again to those who are lost: he who,
as I said, would keep himself in peace and perfectly accomplish the will of
the ardor of the sharp desire of the operation of his spirit, by keeping his senses so
short that they have no operation by virtue of deliberations foreign to
the will of the spirit, that one would then reach, as a legitimate heir, the closest
to the state we are talking about.
Love: This soul would be the eldest daughter of the Most High King, to whom nothing lovable is
lacking. And this lady has reached the state we are talking about where it is the most noble,
and I will tell you how: nothing is empty in her that is not completely filled with
myself; and that is why she can harbor neither anxiety nor
remembrance, so much so that she no longer has any image in her. However, Pity and
courtesy are not far from this soul when needed, that is to say in
their time and in their place.
the soul: It is right that Pity and courtesy are not far from me, for
they were not far from Jesus Christ either by whom I have life again; and
although his sweet soul was glorified as soon as it was united to a mortal body and to
a divine nature in the person of the Son, Pity and courtesy nevertheless remained
in him. He who would be courteous would love only what he should; now, he has never
loved the humanity of the Son of God, he who loves it temporally, and he has never
loved it divinely, he who loves something corporeally; for those
who love his divinity, they feel little of his humanity: never he who feels it
corporeally was joined or united to him, nor was he divinely filled with it. And
what would one feel? If God did not move, nothing would move either!
Now, understand nobly the hidden meaning of this.
Reason: Yes, that such souls are strong, this is clear in the case of
the Baptist.
Love: Was he ever weak and burdened with himself?
the soul: Certainly not! Love does not destroy, but rather instructs, nourishes, and
supports those who trust in him, for he satisfies, he is an abyss and an overflowing
ocean.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 81. Comment cette âme ne se soucie ni d’elle-même, ni de son

neighbour, nor of God Himself
**Love:** Thus, this soul holds its true name from the nothingness where it dwells. And since it is nothing, it cares for nothing, neither for itself, nor for its neighbour, nor for God Himself. Indeed, it is so small that it cannot be found; and every created thing is so distant from it that it cannot feel it; and God is so great that it cannot grasp Him; and for this nothingness, it has come to the security of knowing nothing and wanting nothing. And this nothingness of which we speak gives it everything, and no one can possess it otherwise.
This soul is imprisoned and detained in the land of complete peace, for it is always in full satisfaction; it swims in it, it dives in it, it bathes in it and overflows with divine peace, without moving from within or acting outwardly: these two things would take away this peace if they could penetrate it; but they cannot, for the soul is in a state of sovereignty, and that is why they cannot trouble or disturb it in any way. If it does something outwardly, it is always without itself; if God works His work in it, it is from Himself in it, without it and for it. And this soul is no more burdened by this than its angel is by guarding it, for the angel is no more burdened by guarding us than if he did not guard us. Indeed, this soul is no more burdened by what it does without itself than if it did not do it, for by itself, it has nothing: it has given everything freely, without any "why," for it is the lady of the spouse of its youth, who is the resplendent sun that warms and nourishes the life of what is and comes from his being. This soul has not remained in doubt or sorrow.
**Reason:** But how is that?
**Love:** By a sure alliance and a true agreement to only desire divine dispositions.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 82. Comment cette âme est libre par ses quatre quartiers1

[The author, to the listeners:] The soul that is perfectly there is free by its four quarters. Indeed, a man must have four quarters of nobility before he can be called a gentleman, and the same applies in the spiritual sense. The first quarter by which this soul is free is that it has no reproaches within itself, even if it neither does nor performs the works of the Virtues. In the name of God, understand if you can, you who hear! How could it be that the exercise of Love is accompanied by the works of the Virtues, when the works must cease where Love is exercised?

The second quarter is that it has no will, no more than the dead in the tombs, except only the divine will. This soul cares neither for justice nor for mercy: it establishes and places everything in the sole will of the one who loves it. This is the second quarter by which this soul is free.

The third quarter is that it believes and claims that there was, is, and will never be anyone worse than itself, or who is better loved by the one who loves it as it is. Note this and do not misunderstand it!

The fourth quarter is that it believes and claims this: just as God cannot will anything other than what is good, neither can it will anything other than His divine will. Love has so enriched it with Himself that He makes it claim this, He who, by and through His goodness, has transformed it into this goodness; He who, by and through His love, has transformed it into this love; He who, by and through His divine will, has purely transformed it into this will. He is that very thing of Himself and in Himself for it; and this, it believes and claims, and otherwise it would not be free by all its quarters.

Understand the hidden meaning of this, listeners of this book, for therein lies the grain that nourishes the bride: this applies as long as she is in the state where God makes her be, where she has given her will and therefore can only will the will of the one who, by Himself and for her, has transformed her into His goodness.

And if she is thus free by all her quarters, she loses her name, for she attains sovereignty. That is why she loses it in the one with whom she merges and in whom she abandons herself, by Him, in Him, and for herself, just as water coming from the sea and receiving a name, for example, the Oise, or the Seine or another river: when this water or river returns to the sea, it loses its course and the name under which it flowed through several countries while accomplishing its work; now that it is in the sea and rests there, it has lost this toil. The same goes for this soul; you have enough of this example to find the hidden meaning of its story: it came from the sea and received a name, then it returns there and thus loses its name, and it has no other than that of what it is perfectly transformed into, that is to say, that of the love of the bridegroom of her youth, He who has transformed the bride entirely into Himself: He is, therefore she is; this marvelously suffices her, she is therefore amazed by it; He is Love enjoying, she is therefore love, and this delights her.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 83. Comment cette âme reçoit le nom de la transformation en

which Love has transformed it
**Love:**
Now, this soul is nameless, and that is why it receives the name of
the transformation in which Love has transformed it, just as the waters we
spoke of receive the name "sea," for there is nothing but the sea once
they have entered it.
And there is no nature of fire that does not attract some matter into itself, for
fire makes one single thing of itself and the matter — not two,
but one single thing[^1] —; it is the same with those we speak of: Love attracts
all their matter into itself, and Love and these souls are one same thing —
not two, for there would then be discord between them, but one single thing, and
therefore, there is concord.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 84. Comment l'âme libre par ses quatre quartiers accède à la

sovereignty and lives freely of divine life
**Love:** I said that the soul which is thus free by its four quarters, then attains sovereignty.
**Reason:** Alas! Love, is there no higher gift?
**Love:** But yes! There is one, and it is its nearest neighbor; indeed, when it is thus free by its four quarters and noble in all the branches that descend from it — no villain is taken in marriage, and that is why it is absolutely noble —, the soul then comes to an astonishment that is called "the nothing-thinking of the near Far-Near." Henceforth, it no longer lives only of the life of grace and life according to the spirit, but also of divine life, freely — not gloriously, for it is not glorified, but divinely. Indeed, God has then sanctified it by himself; and there, no one can enter, who is contrary to goodness.
[The author, to the listeners:] Understand properly, for this is valid as long as this soul is in this state; may God grant you to be there continually without leaving it! I say this to those for whom Love had this book made, and to those for whom I wrote it. But you who are not, nor were, nor will be, you would waste your effort trying to understand it: he cannot taste it, who is either not in God without being, or does not have God in him while being. Understand the hidden meaning of this, for what nourishes is what tastes good; it is often said, indeed: "Bad taste poorly nourishes!"
**Reason, she who is encumbered:** Surely, that is well said!
**The soul, seized in the nothing-thinking by this near Far-Near which delights it in peace:** Truly, no one could say or think the grossness and encumbrance of Reason! It is clearly seen in its disciples! A donkey who would listen to them would find nothing to object to! But God has well kept me from such disciples! They will not hold me in their counsel, and I no longer want to listen to their doctrine, for I have adhered to it too long, even if it was good for me. Now, I have better, though they do not know it, for a narrow mind cannot appreciate a thing of great value or understand what Reason does not master; or if it understands it, it will still not be very often! And that is why I say that I no longer want to listen to their grossness; let them not speak to me of it anymore, I can no longer endure it! and I neither have the means nor the reason for it. And this is a work of God, for God works his work in me: I owe him no work, since he himself works in me; and if I added my own, I would undo his work. And thus the disciples of Reason would want, if I believed them, to bring me back to that poverty of their counsel. But they waste their effort, for that is an impossible thing; however, I excuse them for their good intention.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 85. Comment cette âme est libre, plus que libre, parfaitement libre

**Love:** This soul is free, more than free, perfectly free, supremely free, at its root, in its trunk, in all its branches and in all the fruits of its branches.
This soul has as its inheritance a perfect freedom; each of its quarters is adorned with it on its plain[^1]. It answers to no one if it does not wish to and if they are not of its lineage, for a gentleman would not deign to answer a villain who called or summoned him on a battlefield; and that is why, whoever calls this soul does not find it: its enemies receive no response from it anymore.
**The Soul:** That is right. Since I believe God is in me, He must remember me; His goodness cannot lose me.
**Love:** This soul is flayed alive while being put to death, it is set ablaze by the ardor of the fire of charity, and its ashes are cast into the high sea by the annihilation of its will. It possesses a lovable nobility in prosperity, a high nobility in adversity, and an excellent nobility in all places, whatever they may be.
One who is such no longer seeks
God, neither in penance, nor in the sacraments of the Holy Church, nor in thoughts, nor in words, nor in deeds, nor in the creatures below, nor in the creatures above, nor in justice, nor in mercy, nor in glorious glory, nor in divine knowledge, nor in divine love, nor in divine praise[^2].

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 86. Comment Raison est émerveillée de ce qui est dit de cette âme

**Reason:** My God, my God, my God! What is this creature saying? This is enough to astonish the whole world! But what will those whom I have nurtured say? I wouldn't know what to tell them or how to respond to arrange this!

**The Soul:** That does not surprise me! For everything related to this state, they are indeed people who have feet but no path, hands to do nothing, a mouth but no speech, eyes but no light, ears to hear nothing, a reason not to reason, a body not to live, and a heart to understand nothing. That is why those you have nurtured go from surprise to surprise!

**Love:** Yes, truly, these are surprises that greatly surprise them! Indeed, they are too far from the land where one practices this exercise to be up to it; whereas those who are there, who belong to the land where God lives, they are not surprised by it.

**The Liberated Soul:** Oh no! God forbid! for that would be a vile thing; I will tell you and show you how by an example: if a king made to one of his loyal servants a gift so great that he would be rich forever without ever serving again, would a wise man be surprised by it? He certainly should not be, for that would be to blame the king, the gift he made, and the one who is freed by this gift.

**Courtesy:** And I will tell you in what and why: it is because a wise man is not surprised that one does what one ought to do; on the contrary, he praises, appreciates, and loves it; and if he were surprised, he would show thereby that something inappropriate had been done. Whereas the vile of heart and the small-minded, because he does not know, for lack of sense, what honor and courtesy are nor what the gift of a noble lord is, is greatly surprised by it.

**Truth:** It is not surprising, he is indeed the cause, as you have heard.

**The Liberated Soul, in the nobility of her unity:** By God! How could someone sensible be surprised that I speak of great and new things, and that I find everywhere, in everything and in all things, my full satisfaction? My beloved is great, he who makes me a great gift, and as he is always new, he renews this gift for me; and as he is by himself filled and satiated with the abundance of all goods, I am filled and satiated with the abundance of the delights of the goodness that overflows from his divine goodness, without me seeking it with pain and effort in the satisfactions of which this book speaks. He is, and that is what satiates me.

**Pure Courtesy:** That is absolutely right. It is up to the lover, since he is worthy, to satiate his beloved with his goodness.

Martha is troubled, Mary is at peace;
Martha is praised, Mary even more so;
Martha is loved, Mary much more.
Mary has but one spirit in her, that is to say, a single intention, which makes her find peace; but Martha has new ones all the time, so that her peace is constantly troubled; and yet, the free soul can have but one intention.
This soul hears all the time what she does not hear;
She sees all the time what she does not see; Thus she is all the time where she is not; Thus she feels all the time what she does not feel.
And she then possesses her beloved and says:

**The Soul:** I possess him, for he is mine. I will not let him go: he is in my will. Come what may, since he is with me, and it would be my fault to worry.

Divinity
**Love:** This soul is sovereign of the Virtues, daughter of Divinity, sister of Wisdom, and spouse of Love.
**The soul:** It is true, but this seems to Reason a surprising language. This is no wonder, for before long, she will be no more; whereas I am and will always be without failing, for Love has neither beginning, nor end, nor measure, and I am nothing but Love: how then could I have any? That cannot be!
**Reason:** My God! How dare one say such a thing? I dare not listen to it, and truly, Madam, I faint at hearing you... my heart fails me! I am dying!
**The soul:** Alas! Why has she not been dead for a long time! For as long as I possessed you, lady Reason, I could not freely enjoy my inheritance nor what was and is mine; but now, I can enjoy it freely since I have mortally wounded you out of love!
Yes, henceforth, Reason is dead.
**Love, to this soul which is Love itself and nothing but Love, since Love, in its divine goodness, has cast under its feet and put to death without return Reason and the works of the Virtues:** I will tell you what Reason would say if she were alive in you, and what she would ask of you, who are our beloved.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 88 Comment Amour demande ce que Raison demanderait si elle

was alive, namely, who is the mother of Reason and the other Virtues
Love: I will tell you what Reason would ask if she were alive: she
would ask who is her mother and that of the other Virtues, her sisters, and if in turn
they are mothers of someone.
(Answering himself:) Yes, all the Virtues are mothers.
The soul: But of whom? of Peace?
Love: Of Holiness!
The soul: Thus, all the Virtues, they who are sisters of Reason, are mothers of
Holiness?
Love: Yes, but of that Holiness which Reason understands, and not of another.
The soul: And who then will be the mother of the Virtues?
Love: It is Humility, but not the humility that is such by the work of the Virtues,
for this one is the full sister of Reason — I say "sister" because a mother
is more than her child, infinitely more, as you can see for yourself.
The soul, speaking in place of Reason: And from where then is the Humility that is the mother
of these Virtues? Whose daughter is she, and where does she come from to be the mother of such
a great lineage as that of the Virtues, and grandmother of Holiness, of whom the Virtues are
mothers? Who then is the grandmother of this Holiness? Can no one say where
this lineage comes from?
Love: No; he who knows it knows nothing that can be put into words.
The soul: It is true, but I would rather lie than say nothing about it!
This Humility, who is grandmother and mother, is the daughter of divine majesty, so much
so that she is born of Divinity. Deity is her mother, and the grandmother of her branches, whose
offshoots produce fruit in abundance. We will remain silent about it, for speaking of it
spoils it. This Humility has given the trunk and the fruit of these offshoots: that is why the peace of this Far-Near approaches her, he who frees her from all operation. Speaking damages her, thinking darkens her. Far-Near frees her and nothing burdens her anymore: she is free from all service and lives in Freedom.
Who serves, is not free;
Who feels, is not dead;
Who desires, wants;
Who wants, begs;
Who begs is lacking
In divine contentment.
But those who are always loyal to her, they are always invaded by
Love, annihilated by Love and completely stolen by Love; thus they care
only for Love, even if they suffer and endure forever torments as
great as God is great in his goodness. And never did she love subtly,
the soul who would doubt that this is the truth!

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 89. Comment cette âme a tout donné dans la liberté de sa noblesse

**Love:** This soul has given everything in the freedom of the nobility of the work of the Trinity: in it, it establishes its will with such renunciation that it cannot sin unless it tears itself away from it. And if it has nothing with which to sin, it is because no one can sin without will. Therefore, it does not need to guard against it as long as it leaves its will where it is established, that is, in the one who had given it freely in his goodness; but he wanted, in return, to receive it at his prayer from the hand of his beloved, free and stripped, without any "why[^1]" on his part, and this for two reasons: because he wants it, and because he deserves it. Thus, it has not known abundant and continuous peace until it has been purely stripped of its will.

This soul resembles someone who is always drunk: one who is drunk does not care about anything that happens to him, in whatever form events occur, no more than if it did not happen to him; and if he cared, it is because he would not be truly drunk. Similarly, if this soul has anything to will, it is because it is poorly established and can still fall when adversity or prosperity assails it. It is then not "whole," since it is not nothing as long as it has anything to will, and its poverty and its wealth are in wanting to give or retain.

I would like to say this to all those, whether they want it or not, whose desire demands and calls from within towards works of perfection accomplished by cultivating Reason: if they wanted to be what they could be, they would come to the state we are talking about, while at the same time being lords over themselves, over heaven and over earth.

**Reason:** How so, "lords"?

The free soul, which possesses everything without setting its heart on it — for if its heart feels it, it is because it is not there: That, no one can say.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 90. Comment on peut venir à la perfection en faisant le contraire

of his will
**Love:** I said that he who would obey the request coming from within his
mind—if he is provoked to a good will, for otherwise, I do not say it—,
if he left all his external will to live a life according to the spirit, he would
also come to a total lordship.
The spirit, which seeks this very thing in its misguided life: In the name of God, tell us
then how!
The liberated soul: That, no one can say, except he alone who is such in
his creature due to his goodness for her. But I can well tell you that before
reaching it, one must perfectly accomplish the opposite of his will and nourish
the Virtues to the brim, and stand firm without faltering so that the spirit always has
lordship without contradiction.
Truth: My God! How could the body be sick, whose heart encloses such
a spirit?
The liberated soul: I dare well say that this will—and it must be had in the misguided
life, that is to say in the life according to the spirit—, would spoil in a brief instant the
humors of all diseases: such is the remedy of the spirit's ardor.
Love: It is true! Let him try it, who doubts it, and he will know the truth!
Now, I will tell you this: contrary to what happens for the liberated soul,
the life we have spoken of and which we call "life according to the spirit," cannot
find peace if the body does not always do the opposite of its will; it must
be understood that these people do the opposite of what their sensuality wants, and
otherwise, if they did not live contrary to their good pleasure, they
would fall back into the perdition of this life. But those who are free do quite the
opposite: indeed, just as one must do, in the life according to the spirit, the
opposite of his will to not lose peace, conversely, those who are
free do everything that pleases them to not lose peace, since they have
come to the state of Freedom, that is to say since they have fallen from the Virtues into Love,
and from Love into annihilation[^1].

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 115. Où l’on parle de la substance éternelle ; comment Amour

engenders the Trinity in the soul
[The author:] There is an eternal substance, a communicable fruition, an intimate
conjunction: the Father is the eternal substance; the Son is the communicable
fruition; the Holy Spirit is the intimate conjunction. This intimate conjunction
proceeds from the eternal substance and the communicable fruition and it is
made by divine love.
The soul invaded by divine goodness: Yes, Unity, you engender unity: Unity
reflects its ardor in unity; and this divine love of Unity engenders in
the annihilated soul, in the liberated soul, in the glorified soul, the eternal substance, the
communicable fruition, and the intimate conjunction. From this eternal substance,
the memory receives the power of the Father; from this communicable fruition,
the understanding receives the wisdom of the Son; and from the intimate conjunction, the will
receives the goodness of the Holy Spirit, goodness which conjoins it in the love of the Father and the
Son. This conjunction establishes the soul in the being without being which is the Being, and this Being
is the Holy Spirit itself which is the love of the Father and the Son. This love of the Holy
Spirit flows into the soul and spreads in abundance of delights, by the unique
and eminent gift that the sovereign Beloved makes in a very chosen and
masterful conjunction, when he gives himself in his simplicity by making himself simple. And he gives himself
in simplicity in that he shows that there is nothing outside of him, from whom all things
derive their being, so that there is nothing outside of him in love, which is light, union
and praise: there is only one will, one love, one operation in
two natures, one goodness, thanks to the conjunction operated by the force of the
transformation of love of my beloved, boundless domain of the overflow
of divine love, divine love that the divine will exercises in me and for me,
without me possessing it.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Notes > Miroir, cf. par exemple Hadewijch :

...to be loved or hm, refusal, desire, gain or loss, convenience or discomfort, profit,
harm, honor and shame, to be with God in celestial consolations, or
in the pains of hell: this fire makes no difference.
It consumes everything it touches: of damnation or blessing, there is no longer
any question, I assure you.
(Mengeldichten, XVI, trans. Porion)
The spring of this indifference which has often scandalized, of which we have said elsewhere that it is not insensitivity but impassibility (cf. supra, ch. 16, note
5), is the true nature of happiness: it is to love, says the *Miroir*, or to be
with God, says Hadewijch, whatever the circumstances of this union with
God; so much so that the only decisive questions after examining all the
trials of love — and ultimately, the trial of hell — will be the following
(cf. end of ch. 131): and if God preferred that I love another than him? and if...

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Notes > Dieu préférait aimer un autre que moi ? et si Dieu préférait qu’un autre que moi

I love him more than myself? There, in all mystical literature, is the only true trial of which all others are but a faint echo, a dizzying point where one must risk everything and where all of man's freedom is at stake against that of God: there, it is clear that love is a gift or it is not. Thus, it is in this gift and radical abandonment that "the soul emerges from its infancy," and "there the Land of Freedom was revealed" (cf. all of ch. 132).

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Notes > Jean de la Croix, Paris, 1981, 2e lecture : Temps et désir.

59,   1. Cf. supra, ch. 27, note 1.
59,   2. "... no Soul can speak of this precious enclosure, by which it is
forgotten through the annihilation of the knowledge that this annihilation brings
to itself.
59,   3. It is we who add "with" according to the context.
60,   1. "... this understanding is strong and subtle and very noble (which the sanguine
are naturally aided by); and without the haste of the cutting will of the ardor of
the spirit's desire, the choleric are naturally aided by this." The entire
passage is almost incomprehensible, likely altered in the original.
We translate it according to the general sense of the Latin version. As for the
"cutting will of the ardor of the spirit's desire," which is found in equivalent
formulas in ch. 60, 79, 94, 118, notably, it characterizes the
will in the "life according to the spirit" (cf. Introduction p. 35).
Moreover, the characterology alluded to here by the *Miroir* (we will find it again in ch. 99) is classical since Galen. It considers four dominant "humors" in man which oppose each other in pairs parallel to the four elements (cf. supra, ch. 5, note 5): choleric (due to bile), characterized by quickness to anger and strength of will; lymphatic, or phlegmatic (due to phlegm), characterized by indolence and weakness; melancholic (due to black bile), characterized by sadness; sanguine (due to blood), characterized by cheerfulness and inconstancy.
60,    2. The staging is a bit complicated throughout this chapter. We
add here "to the listeners" as the soul does not respond to Love,
but rather seems to apologize for its lengthiness to the listeners, as Love did a bit earlier.
61,    1. On these seven states, cf. Prologue, note 6.
61,    2. "... in Freedom of charity." One could also understand: "freed from charity," in light of ch. 65.
62,    1. This chapter logically follows ch. 60, with ch. 61 seeming rather
a parenthesis.
62,    2. We translate this sentence from the English, the corresponding French
passage ("... but yet they want to do nothing about it.") being unclear.
63,    1. Allusion to a difficult-to-identify evangelical passage, perhaps Luke 22,
28-29.
64,    1. In the original, the previous sentence, against all likelihood, is
already attributed to Love.
65,    1. The mountain is the one at the end of ch. 9.
65,    2. Classic sentence of spiritual literature based on the wordplay:
*anima* - *animare* - *amare* = soul - give life - love.
66,    1. "... it will not be long before she comes to an end," these two replies —
perhaps interpolated? — fit poorly into the context.
66,    2. "... cloaked in love."
67,    1. Cf. supra, ch. 14, note 1; and infra, ch. 85, note 2.
69,    1. "... for the gift of him cannot be given in form."
69,    2. Based on Gen 30, 1-5; 35, 16-20; Ps 67, 28, the opposition of Rachel
and Benjamin becomes, for the spiritual tradition, that of discursive knowledge
and contemplative knowledge; both actually stem from a single desire for God — thus the *Miroir* does not condemn Reason
as long as it stays in its place (cf. for example ch. 65) —, but according to two different and discontinuous qualities; hence the necessary disappearance of Reason when
union with God becomes immediate. Cf. for example the same allegory developed
by Richard of Saint-Victor a century before the *Miroir*:
This gift [= contemplation] comes from God, and not from man's merit.
But without a doubt, no one receives such a great grace without immense zeal
and ardent desire. Rachel knows this, and that is why she increases her
zeal and inflames her desire more each day. Indeed, in this
tension of daily effort, in this immensity of pain, Benjamin is born and
Rachel dies, for when the spirit of man is taken above itself, it
surpasses all the narrowness of human ratiocination: all human reason
succumbs to the contact of what it sees of the divine light when it is
elevated above itself and taken in ecstasy. What then is the death of

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Notes > Rachel, sinon la défaillance de la raison ? Ainsi, à la naissance de Benjamin,

Rachel dies, for the spirit, enraptured in contemplation, experiences all the
failure of human reason (Benjamin Minor, ch. 73-74).
69,   3. Cf. Jn 4, 20-24.
70,   1. On the entirety of this chapter, cf. Prologue, note 6.
70,   2. Here, it would undoubtedly be necessary to introduce another interlocutor, due to the
change in grammatical person.
70,    3. On the innocence of Adam before the sin, cf. infra, ch. 94, note 2. Furthermore, the Latin and English versions add here a few words whose meaning is
as follows: "... except those of those who are naked and forgotten, for they have
nothing to hide."
71,    1. "And such union of complete peace joins and conjoins me by the
sovereign height of the creation of the apparatus of the divine being, from which I have
being, which is being."
71,    2. "... the intention of the gloss": it is again about the understanding of the
"perfect"; cf. supra, ch. 43, note 4.
72,    1. Cf. supra, ch. 62.
72,    2. On the angelology of the *Mirror*, cf. supra, ch. 5, note 3.
72,    3. Cf. supra, ch. 62.
73,    1. These are the 5th and 6th states of ch. 61.
73,    2. Allusion to ch. 2 and 5 of the book of Esther.
74,    1. Cf. end of ch. 9.
74,    2. "His dangers can do nothing but glorious life." Difficult phrase to
interpret.
74,    3. Wordplay: "... it is Mary of peace, and therefore it is Mary of peace, that
Fine Love feeds her." The opposition between Martha and Mary, based on Lk 10,
38-42 and Jn 11, traditionally illustrates the superiority of the contemplative life
over the active life. It will be found several times in the *Mirror* (ch. 86;
124), and it is absolutely universal in spiritual literature.
Furthermore, the same tradition generally confuses — perhaps rightly so —
the evangelical characters of Mary sister of Lazarus, and Mary Magdalene
(cf. for example ch. 76 and 93 of the *Mirror*). It should be noted that the numerous
references in the *Mirror* to Mary Magdalene reflect the growing importance of
her cult and hagiography in the 13th century.
75,   1.  Cf. Mt    17, 1-9; Mk 9, 2-10; Lk    9, 28-36.
75,   2.   "... And since he teaches us this, why would we not do it?" The
connection of this sentence with the context is not clear. Perhaps it should be understood
: "since it is he who teaches us to hide — like the disciples on the

And I am the one who takes it away.

"In the transformation of love, this soul is in a certain way like Adam in the state of innocence; he did not know what evil was, for he was so innocent that he did not understand evil nor did he judge anything as evil." (Cantique B, 26, 14).
