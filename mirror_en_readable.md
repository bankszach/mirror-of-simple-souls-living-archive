## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Introduction > Qu’est-ce qu’un miroir ?

**Soul:**
I am in great anguish
And in pain and in distress
For the annihilation
Of my freedom and courtesy.

**Reason:**
Do not complain, I pray you,
For Love will deliver you
From this pain and distress.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Introduction > Genre littéraire - Mise en scène - Lire au Moyen Age

Medieval literature is rich with several hundred "Mirrors" of all sorts: Mirrors of nature, Mirrors of history, Mirrors of morality—all share the common goal of "reflecting" this or that aspect of reality to the eyes of a reader who is primarily a spectator. This means that a Mirror is much more than a modern book: a reflection of reality, it also aims to reflect the one who observes it; or rather, it will allow the coincidence of the two through an inner transformation of a sacramental order, which the book in the Middle Ages could aspire to.

We must forget here the invention of the printing press and the massive dissemination of texts in the form of a manufactured product that we passively digest in the silence of our reading rooms: the book in the 13th century is a rare and costly object, scarcely distributed outside religious communities or nascent universities.

As for reading, it is almost a profession in itself; the notation of the text in the 13th century remains imprecise and leaves the reader a considerable margin of interpretation, somewhat like a Gregorian musical score. As a result, even individual reading is very generally vocal, and thus rhythmic, expressive, slow, and public by its very nature. Here we see the outline of a whole scenic play, the distribution of which through the roles of our Mirror will only be an accentuation. The recipients are moreover designated sometimes as readers, sometimes as listeners, or better: as "listeners who will read this book" (ch. 37)! This ambiguity, a reflection of the book's situation in the 13th century, is not unique to our Mirror: it can be detected throughout many contemporary texts as an address to the public beyond the mere readers.

Before going further, one might wonder here about the importance that should be attributed to the almost theatrical staging of the Mirror, and notably to the respective roles of Reason, Love, the soul, etc., intervening as distinct proclaimers. The question actually touches on the birth of European theater, the "mysteries" performed at cathedral doors, and the oratorical jousts of chivalric "courts of love." Reconstructing the exact conditions of the Mirror's proclamation is impossible and would clash with the most divergent theories of specialists on these matters.

Let us simply note that the length of the text forbids imagining its pure and simple representation on stage, and its difficulty forbids imagining it with a large and unprepared audience; let us also note the flatness of the scenic play despite interludes occupied by genuine verbal juggling, and we will agree that we are dealing with a text intended to be read by several people, conventionally borrowing the form of elementary theater in vogue at the time, this form eventually disappearing, as we will see, towards the final chapters. The method is not isolated: the personification of Virtues, Reason, or Love as so many actors, facilitated by the general economy of the article in the languages of the time, is most widespread in medieval literature and governs, for example, the entire structure of the Romance of the Rose.

That said, the medieval book itself is not yet a Mirror. The word carries a very strong visual connotation and contains, as we have said, an invitation to mirror oneself to get closer to an admired reality; what is at stake here is the Platonic, but above all Christian, conception of knowledge: it is contemplation and not action that transforms and assimilates to the contemplated object; "Because we will see God, we will be like Him," says Saint John to explain the beatitude of the elect. Thus, the Mirror of Simple Souls is also the one that makes the soul simple.

Now, if the book is no longer today what it once was, the mirror from which ours borrows its name is no more! The ancient mirror presents itself as an object of polished and shimmering metal, rare and expensive as well, with multiple and variable reflections, very far from our modern mirrors and their functional clarity. When Saint Paul contrasts the knowledge of God here below "in a mirror, enigmatically," with the clear vision of the beyond, he clearly shows the ambiguous play of a mysterious object that hides as much as it reveals: it is through laborious accommodation—the monastic rumination of the text—that this mirror gradually focuses all our faculties of knowing and loving. As a result, in the mortal conditions that are ours, its function will be to introduce us to the contemplative universe, that of the Word of God in whom all things come to life, Himself the mirror of the Father giving life to all things: "Alas! alas! my child! mirror that gladdened my heart and in which I have so often contemplated myself with joy!" has Suso say to the Virgin Mary at the foot of the cross. Such a contemplative intention will be at the heart of our Mirror, and forgetting it would lead to serious misunderstandings.

A contemplative viewpoint

"I beseech you by love: listen with great application of that subtle understanding which is in you... Otherwise, all those who hear this will misunderstand it" (Prologue). We are thus warned from the first page of the Mirror, and its author will continue to renew this warning thereafter, undoubtedly in vain since he will lose his life and the honor of his orthodoxy because of it! The Mirror is not written for everyone: "I say this to those for whom Love has made this book... But you who are nothing, ... you would waste your effort trying to understand it" (ch. 84). And if it is not written for everyone, it is not because it is reserved for the adepts of the occult sciences, but because it presupposes that Love itself grants the understanding to the reader through a free and highly personal election (ch. 13), without which, "because of their simplistic way of understanding, other creatures... would receive harm from it" (ch. 17).

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Introduction > Quelle est cette expérience particulière sous-jacente au Miroir ? Elle n’est pas

that of Reason, of Virtues, or of Holiness (ch. 88), "not against the Virtues, but above them" (ch. 103), not the daughter of Holiness, but the mother of Holiness (ch. 88). She is in contact with God "without intermediary" (cf. ch. 64), "without any why" (cf. ch. 81, note 1), she is, within the very Trinity, the immediate experience of the birth of God in the heart of man, the experience of the Word becoming flesh in us (cf. ch. 80, note 3; 85, note 2; 115, note 1; ch. 42; etc.), a Christian experience if there ever was one, even if not all Christians have this experience, for while all are part of "Holy Little Church" (little for spiritual life, but not for number), only a few are part of "Holy Great Church" which holds the key: "These souls [= Holy Great Church] are properly called Holy Church in that they support, teach, and nourish the whole Holy Church; and not they, but the entire Trinity through them" (ch. 43). Thus, it is indeed the same Church, but according to two states of awareness: "Reason remains in us, but Love remains in them" (id.), says the Little to the Great. From one to the other, we see throughout the Mirror an inversion of the experimental flow that ceases to ascend with effort from effects to causes to grasp everything at its root as a free gift of a bottomless love, and this according to an intensity and lucidity that we are told are "an ocean of Joy, ... an ocean of delights that flow and stream from the Divinity; ... this soul... is joy itself, and thus it swims and flows in joy without feeling any joy, for it remains in Joy and Joy remains in it: it is joy itself by the force of Joy that has transformed it into itself" (ch. 28).

This radical experience of God, the one found in Ruusbroec, Catherine of Siena, John of the Cross, or Thérèse of the Child Jesus, is called by a more modern terminology a mystical experience. It is not a matter here of describing it—we provide the essential elements of such a description throughout our notes—but of affirming it and affirming that it is this that the Mirror explores, even if this exploration can only be done from the outside, that is, under the mediated jurisdiction of Reason which allows for dissociation, and thus to speak, of what the immediate experience of Love continually tends to associate, and thus to silence, for better enjoyment: "These creatures can no longer speak of God, for just as they cannot say where God is, they cannot say WHO God is. Indeed, whoever speaks of God when he wants, to whom he wants, and where he wants to speak, must know without any doubt that he has never felt the true heart of divine love...; these souls are accustomed to understanding much and forgetting everything because of the subtlety of their lover" (ch. 18).

Unfortunately, this experience of Love will easily be denied by the jealous Reason, for lack of modesty, for lack of that virtue it preaches and which would have conferred all its nobility if it had practiced it by faithfully protecting the sleep of lovers (ch. 65). Here we can guess the conflict that all spirituals have announced and which carries in germ the condemnation of the Mirror and its author, perfectly anticipated in chapter 85. And yet, in the name of Reason, let us listen here to an intelligent censor of the Free Spirit a century after the Mirror, Chancellor Gerson, the foremost intellectual authority of his time: "Scholastic men, even without inner experience, can properly deal with writings of inner experience and mystical theology, provided they give them credit." Indeed, "as no one knows the things of the spirit except the spirit that is in him [allusion to I Co 2, 11], those who do not want to believe until they understand are unfit and absolutely incapable of hearing mystical theology" (De Mystica Theologia, trat. I, cons. 8 and 5).

Lacking this modesty, which nevertheless authorizes any reasonable man to read the Mirror without necessarily sharing the experience, the Inquisition courts will send our text and its author to the stake. Tracing now their double historical path will allow us to illustrate through a remarkable case this ongoing trial—de facto but not de jure—of Reason against Love, of a false theology against a true mysticism.
A long trial that still continues
The milieu of the ‹béguines›. Marguerite Porete and the Mirror. Spirituality and courtliness
Marguerite Porete will be designated as a ‹béguine› in the acts of her trials, and her spiritual kinship with the most famous of them, Hadewijch of Antwerp or Beatrice of Nazareth for example, is evident from their literary proximity as well as from the little we know of her life. In the 1280s, the word ‹béguine› could designate either members of ‹béguinal› communities in the strict sense—which seems to be the usage of the Mirror in chapter 122—or, following a devaluation of the word throughout the 13th century, any person leading a spiritual life of some intensity in the practice of evangelical counsels. Both have in common the escape from traditional canonical forms of religious life and are regularly confined by opinion, as well as by ecclesiastical authorities, to the heretical limits of spiritual freedom, if not formally of the Free Spirit, in more or less close dependence on the Cathar and Waldensian movements. It is among them that all the religious vitality of the northern countries from the 12th to the 14th century seems to be concentrated: not only Hadewijch and Beatrice, but Marie of Oignies, Ides of Nivelles, Saint Lutgard, and probably Marguerite Porete herself, are to be connected to the ‹béguinal› current, albeit to different degrees of belonging. At the time of the Mirror, the great homeland of the ‹béguines› is constituted by the Rhineland countries, even if their diffusion throughout Europe can be observed.

The original independence of the ‹béguines› made them particularly vulnerable to ecclesiastical trials from the 12th to the 14th century, the end of Marguerite Porete being a characteristic example; thus their protection was organized—with an inevitable loss of autonomy—in two directions: on the one hand, a "federation" of the ‹béguines› among themselves led from the beginning of the 13th century to these sorts of enclosed villages in the heart of the northern cities known as ‹béguinages›; a certain communal life—living in small individual houses or larger convents, works of charity, work, infirmary, teaching—took shape under the vigilance of one of them, the "great lady" (Hadewijch probably was one). The ‹béguinage› thus became a legal, economic, and soon canonical entity, with its resources, exemptions, but also social constraints unknown to the first generations. On the other hand, the protection of new religious congregations, of a fairly similar original inspiration—protection of the Norbertines then the Cistercians in the 12th century, the Dominicans and Franciscans at the time of the Mirror—the efforts of churchmen such as Jacques de Vitry and Thomas of Cantimpré in the 1210s, led to a desirable recognition and an inevitable integration of the ‹béguinal› life within medieval institutions. But here we see the danger of having to choose one day or another between the initial independence of the ‹béguines› and this finally acquired stability: gradually, notably under the severe condemnations of the 14th century that will strike both Master Eckhart or a simple Marguerite Porete as well as genuine sectarians of the Free Spirit, the ‹béguinal› life will tend to take on reassuring canonical forms, in the mendicant third orders or by adopting the rule of Saint Augustine for example, with conditions of survival and renewal very diverse from one region to another.

The identification of the ‹béguine› Marguerite Porete as the author of the Mirror of Simple Souls is a recent acquisition in the history of spirituality, due to Romana Guarnieri in 1946. We can only refer the reader to her considerable work for the precise chronology of the text and its author, at least for the little we know of it. Here we will only provide necessary reference points at the heart of a spiritual tradition that is not that of the heterodox currents forming the "Free Spirit"—to which Marguerite Porete has generally been linked—but that of the great classics of northern mysticism in the 13th and 14th centuries.

Marguerite Porete's birth can be situated around 1250 in Hainaut, perhaps in Valenciennes, a city that seems to be hers through her trials, even if the last of them will lead her to Paris where she will be burned alive in 1310. Historically and geographically, she thus belongs as much to the Germanic world as to the Latin world. Her language is French, but a careful reading of the Mirror notes numerous Flemishisms, indicators of a nearby linguistic border. Her excellent knowledge of contemporary Flemish mysticism also suggests that she probably knew how to share its language. Religiously, she belongs to the diocese of Cambrai, then covering a depth of twenty leagues along the right bank of the Scheldt, from its source to Antwerp, a situation that will involve, through the successive instances of her trials, a judicial itinerary passing through the Rhineland countries—and here we see a community of destiny with Master Eckhart on the side of Cologne—before ending in Paris.

Spiritually and culturally, we still encounter Marguerite Porete at a crossroads: the Mirror abounds with implicit references—and therefore difficult to identify—to the Latin patristic tradition, to secular courtly literature, but especially to the ‹béguinal› tradition. We will highlight one or another in our notes, but it is a climate, more than clear references, except for numerous quasi-biblical citations. Undoubtedly, Marguerite Porete was a cultured woman, not of a scholastic and ostentatious culture, but of a science as profound as it is discreet, worthy of her predecessors of half a century, Hadewijch or Beatrice: we feel in her the same impregnation of the Victorine school, of Saint Bernard and William of Saint-Thierry; we feel her especially involved in the same chivalrous conquest of "‹Fin Amour›"—the "emprise" of chapter 118: the ardor and intrepidity of the Mirror, without a male example at the time, breathe the "rage to love" of the first two, in defiance of all scholastic conventions and to the benefit of a mystical extension of a waning courtly literature. The only question for Marguerite Porete, a woman of the 13th century, is that of love, of Love "as such," and without modern distinctions between good and bad, for "Love is God, and God is Love" (ch. 21).

We must be fully aware here of the courtly component that lends its vocabulary and staging to the Mirror and to a whole part of the surrounding spiritual literature. The framework of the Mirror, let us note, is the Romance of Alexander (cf. Prologue, note 4), and Courtesy is one of the important protagonists of the scenic play. The word itself covers all the qualities of the courtly man (the "curialitas" of the Latin versions of the text), as opposed to the villain (an opposition that the Mirror echoes several times); and this at a time when courtly life now rests less on martial realities than on the pursuit and definition of Pure Love (Fénelon will not have exhausted the subject four centuries later!). If courtesy still characterizes an art of living made of politeness and chivalrous generosity (the same attributed to Alexander the Great), it then especially indicates a will to pursue to the end, theoretically and practically, the fullness of the amorous experience. ‹Fin Amour› is therefore the proper object of courtly pursuit, and the Mirror regularly qualifies the simple and annihilated soul as the one who "demands ‹Fin Amour›." In the first courtly literature, that of the troubadours of the langue d'oc, ‹Fin Amour› is the fruit of the intrepid fidelity of the lover in all the trials imposed by his lady (fruit of the "jovens"), and its characteristic is Joy, conquering enthusiasm as well as a feeling linked to the complete possession of the beloved object. In the northern courtesy inherited by the Mirror, these notions become spiritualized and internalized, but without losing any of their strength, ready for the use that Hadewijch will make of them (the "minne fijn" is correlated with the "orewoet," the "rage to love"), in the line of transpositions already operated by Saint Bernard and William of Saint-Thierry.

It is within this framework that we must now specify the trajectory of the Mirror and Marguerite Porete. It is around the tumultuous appearance of the work in the 1290s that we can organize what we know of it.
From the ‹béguinage› to the stake.
The Mirror through the centuries
What the reception of the Mirror was like can be guessed in its chapter 122: "The ‹béguines› declare that I am lost, and so do the priests, the clerics and the preachers, the Augustinians, the Carmelites, and the friars minor...!" Faced with this coalition, it is likely that Marguerite Porete did not refuse the fight, and we know that she did what was necessary to obtain an unofficial but important approval of her work, the one that appears at the head of some of its Latin and English versions. She owed it to Godefroid of Fontaines, former regent at the faculty of theology in Paris in the years 1285-1286, and to two other censors difficult to identify, one of whom we know was attached to the Brabantine Cistercian family (and who can therefore be supposed to be a spiritual son of Saint Bernard and William of Saint-Thierry, so present in the Mirror), the other attached to the Franciscan family of the friars minor. But despite this approval, the bishop of Cambrai will condemn the Mirror in 1300, have it publicly burned in Valenciennes, and threaten its author with recourse to the secular arm in case of recidivism.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Introduction > Cette récidive ne tarda guère : nous savons qu’en 1306-1307, Marguerite Porete

sent copies of the Mirror to various notables, notably the bishop of Châlons-sur-Marne, perhaps hoping to see the initial approval strengthened. However, the result was new denunciations and another diocesan trial, while the bishop of Cambrai was now Philippe de Marigny, a damned soul of Philippe the Fair, one of his accomplices in the persecution of the Templars. The higher judicial authority brought Marguerite Porete before the Inquisition of Haute-Lorraine, and from there to the Inquisition of Paris, in the hands of Guillaume de Paris, also perfectly compromised by Philippe the Fair in the fight against the Templars. It is in the face of these executioners that one must evaluate the prisoner's attitude: refusal to take an oath of loyalty—a prerequisite for the trial's proceedings—which would have made her a collaborator of an iniquitous apparatus; refusal, then, to receive absolution for sins she maintained she had not committed. Clearly, one cannot simply and purely identify this double refusal with a rejection of the ecclesiastical institution as such and its sacraments. Nevertheless, excommunicated for such obstinacy but unwavering in her good faith—because undoubtedly unwavering in her faith—Marguerite "of Hainaut, called Porete," was declared a relapsed heretic on May 30, 1310, after the Mirror was examined by a commission of theologians. The next day, she was handed over to the secular arm to be publicly burned with the incriminated work, and the execution took place on June 1 at the Place de Grève; the account we have mentions, as in all such circumstances, the dignity of the victim, the harshness of the punishment, the tears of the crowd, and the inevitable last-minute attempts by admirers.

But the story of the Mirror does not end with that of its author. Its theological dossier was then transferred to Vienne, in Dauphiné, where the famous council that would massively condemn Nordic mysticism, especially that of Meister Eckhart and that of the Mirror, generally conflated with the deviations of the Free Spirit sects, was held in 1311-1312. What remains of the records of the various trials, as well as the articles of the Council of Vienne, shows the extent of the misunderstanding. In essence, where Marguerite Porete speaks of transcending virtue and morality, her judges read an opposition to virtue; where she speaks of union with God, they read an identification with God; where she speaks of inner peace, they read a perverse nihilism; where she speaks of worshipping God in spirit and truth, they understand a sacrilegious renunciation of Christian institutions.

None of Marguerite Porete's own warnings served, nor any of her professions of Catholic faith in the Mirror (for example, in chapters 14-15), not even her clearest affirmations on THE NECESSITY FOR MAN TO DO HIS PART IN ALL THAT PERTAINS TO REASON, THE PART OF LOVE BEING THAT OF GOD AND GOD ALONE: "I make known to all who will hear this book, that we must reproduce in ourselves as much as we can—through devout thoughts, through works of perfection, through the demands of Reason—all the life that Jesus Christ led and preached to us... This we must do to gain victory over ourselves. And if we did it as much as we could, we would come to possess Him while putting out of ourselves all thoughts, all works of perfection, and all demands of Reason, for we would have no use for them: divinity would then operate in us, for ourselves and without ourselves, its divine works" (ch. 113). In each condemnation, it is clear that what we have called above the "contemplative point of view" is at stake, and that Marguerite Porete's judges see, in terms of liberation from the Law, only the immoral libertinism of the sects of the time, an avalanche of black masses, vile sacrifices, and fornication.

Whatever the spirituality, the historian notes here that the condemnation of the Council of Vienne would henceforth assimilate the Mirror to a heretical work, regularly confiscated by the Inquisitions throughout Europe until the Renaissance, an eloquent testimony to its success and dissemination. And this reputation would be received without further examination by almost all modern works, admittedly few in number, that would marginally mention the Mirror among the witnesses of beguine spirituality.

The reputation of heresy and the small number of manuscripts that survived the confiscations have indeed certainly led to an underestimation of the Mirror's importance in modern research. But that it enjoyed great success during its author's lifetime and afterward is evident both from the impressive staging of her trials—all the authorities of the Sorbonne participated—and the Inquisition's efforts to stop its circulation, but especially from its traces in subsequent spiritual literature, both orthodox and heretical—but does not heresy itself use the Gospel? This dissemination first took the Mirror across the Channel, translated in the first half of the 14th century in the Carthusian monasteries of England along with other texts of similar inspiration. It was then found circulating in Latin and Italian around 1430 in northern Italy, where Saint Bernardino of Siena, Saint Lawrence Giustiniani, Saint John of Capistrano, and many others tried to stop the progress of the Free Spirit, unfortunately without taking the time to examine case by case the validity of previous condemnations while introducing the best of Nordic spirituality to southern Europe. Thus, alongside a French tradition, we see the emergence of Latin, English, and Italian traditions of the Mirror. What must not be forgotten in their formation is the extraordinarily complex nature of the orthodox and heterodox currents with which they were then associated. We can only refer here to the whole question of sects in the Middle Ages, from the Bulgarians to the Spanish Alumbrados, passing through the Cathars, in constant interference with the most solid mystical traditions. Any reader of Suso, Ruusbroec, or Eckhart senses in them the fear of possible confusions, the pressure of an ever-vigilant Inquisition, the weight of words understood differently by accusers and accused, the weight, above all, of politico-religious interests infinitely exceeding mere doctrinal concerns. We are at the heart of a problem that absolutely all of Europe is the stage for. It is out of the question to analyze it here; many elements, valid from a historical point of view, have been gathered by Romana Guamieri in the already cited work. Nor is it a question of undertaking here a point-by-point rehabilitation of the Mirror that would only interest specialists; — we reserve it possibly for another publication —: we will content ourselves with highlighting the most sensitive points in our notes, the debate having significantly eased over seven centuries, simply because there is nothing to gain in heresy today! What the modern reader will retain from the Mirror is no longer a possible liberation from ecclesiastical structures, but a liberation from oneself, it is the rage for the absolute we mentioned earlier, the peace it brings beyond all anguish, the certainty of being loved, even to the heart of hell if necessary.

Reading the Mirror
The Sufferings of a Translator
Rendering the Mirror into modern French is a source of despair, and we feel we have transformed the shimmering object mentioned earlier into a product as anonymous as industrial ice cream. This is because our Mirror is also such by its style: it casts its lights in multiple directions and juxtaposes its facets rather than developing a theme linearly. Its progress will be to associate images, not to chain arguments; hence the disorientation of a first reading, especially since the author clearly enjoys multiplying optical illusions as if to invite us to continually surpass the fragile victories of Reason over Love: her art, very feminine, is that of a lace-maker inventing endless twists, turns, and reprises ("I sing and I unsing," says the soul in chapter 80), without much concern for the reader's impatience and at the risk of her preciousness being mistaken for esotericism.

A first difficulty comes from the fact that the primary meaning of the text often eludes numerous readings or re-readings, without one ever knowing very well if a material corruption of the text is at fault, or simply the author's taste for the most convoluted verbal constructions. In the most difficult cases, or during truly untranslatable wordplay, we modestly transcribe the original in a note, often without comment, hoping the reader will be more skillful than us. Similarly, we have transcribed the two small poems placed at the beginning and end of the text to preserve a bit of its medieval flavor.

Next, it is practically impossible to render the oral and declamatory quality of the text, whose importance we mentioned in the 13th century; the variations in its rhythm, the concentrations of assonances in places, cannot be fully respected; repetitions like those transcribed in notes 6 and 7 of the Prologue are practically untranslatable. Moreover, modern grammar no longer admits the medieval imprecisions rich in double meanings: changing eras in a language is always more delicate than changing languages in an era.

Finally, an inevitable devaluation of vocabulary over the centuries has forced us to choose from the richness of certain words; all the courtly charge of part of the spiritual vocabulary, notably, disappears when one translates, for example, "franchise" as "freedom," or "villenie" as "insult," translations that are difficult to avoid. What can be said, to conclude, of the irreducible change of gender, and therefore of sex, of the main character of the Mirror, that is to say, Love, feminine in the 13th century, masculine since? And it is all the relationships of the scenic play that are affected without possible correction.

Original Text and Translations
We have outlined above the conditions of the Mirror's dissemination. Few copies have reached us through successive campaigns of destruction, too few to allow the necessary cross-checks to establish a critically uncontestable starting text. As things stand, we have thirteen almost complete manuscripts of the Mirror, one French, three English, four Latin, five Italian. Compared to the others, the French manuscript (Condé F XIV 26 from Chantilly) clearly testifies to a state of the text that is very little accommodated and corrected, very close to the original (and we will designate it as such in our notes for simplicity), while the others too regularly suppress the literary or doctrinal difficulties of the French text to be used without reservations. Among them, only the English and three of the Latin versions seem to translate directly from the original French, the others retranslating the Latin or English. Thus, we proceeded as follows in our own translation into modern French: we used almost exclusively the Chantilly text in the diplomatic edition given by Romana Guamieri; in case of a manifest gap—notably for chapters 134 to 137 missing due to the binding of the Chantilly manuscript and which Romana Guamieri then gives in Latin—or of an inextricable difficulty (the Mirror does not lack them!), we first consulted the direct Latin versions (currently preserved in three manuscripts of the Vatican Library; we generally used Rossiano 4), and then the English version in the edition given by Clara Kirchberger (The Mirror of Simple Souls, London, 1927). We will always note these deviations from the Chantilly text.

Scenic Indications and Characters
In the original, the designation of interlocutors and some scenic indications or author's remarks appear at the head of the replies and are generally repeated throughout the text (e.g., "Love: Such a Soul, says Love,..."), interrupting and considerably burdening it. We have systematically grouped these indications at the head of the replies, detaching them typographically. When they are purely and simply repeated throughout the reply, we have not repeated them; conversely, when they are missing, we have added them in brackets, with a note when the attribution to such or such interlocutor seems questionable.

Moreover, the degree of personification of courtesy, charity, faith, virtue, etc., is not always clear: we will play on the use of uppercase and lowercase letters (for example: courtesy and Courtesy) without claiming to have always chosen correctly.

Some Vocabulary Landmarks
To conclude, we think we will save the reader time by grouping here some key expressions of the Mirror. The text has little plan (it "shimmers"), so it is in relation to a diffuse general scheme of spiritual life that one must navigate, a scheme essentially constituted by the seven states and the three lives of the soul. The following table distributes the fundamental spiritual vocabulary of the Mirror according to the place it occupies in this whole.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Prologue

The soul, touched by God and stripped of sin in the first state of grace, has ascended through divine graces to the seventh state of grace, a state where it possesses its perfection in fullness in the land of life through divine enjoyment. Love speaks here: O you, active and contemplative, perhaps even annihilated by true love, you who are about to hear some of the wonders of pure love, of noble love, of the elevated love of the liberated soul, you who are about to hear how the Holy Spirit has set its sail in her as in its vessel, I beseech you by love: listen with great application of that subtle understanding which is in you, and with great diligence! Otherwise, for lack of being thus disposed, all those who hear this will misunderstand it.

Now, understand with humility a simple example, borrowed from worldly love, and apply it similarly to divine love:

There was once a young lady, a king's daughter, with a great and noble heart, and noble courage as well, and she resided in a foreign land. Now it happened that this young lady heard of the great courtesy and great nobility of King Alexander, and immediately her will loved him for his great renown as a gentleman. But she lived so far from this great lord in whom she had placed her love, that she could neither see him nor have him, and she was often desolate within herself, for no other love than this satisfied her. When she saw that this distant love, while being so close within her, was so far outside, this young lady thought to console her sorrow by imagining some figure of the beloved whose heart often wounded her. So she had an image painted in the likeness of the king she loved, as close as possible to what she imagined him to be in her love, and according to the affection of the love that overwhelmed her; and thanks to this image and by other artifices, she thought of the king himself.

The soul who had this book written: But yes, truly! This is indeed what I mean: I heard of a king of great power, who was in courtesy, in very great courtesy of nobility and generosity, a noble Alexander. But he was so far from me, and I was so far from him, that I could find no comfort within myself; and to remember him, he gave me this book which represents in some way his love. But although I have his image, I am nonetheless in a foreign land, far from the palace where the very noble friends of this lord reside, those who are completely pure, refined, and liberated thanks to the gifts of the king with whom they dwell.

The author: That is why we will tell you how Our Lord is not at all freed from Love, while Love is freed from him for us, so that humble people may hear it on the occasion of what is destined for you, for Love can do everything without harming anyone.

And Love speaks thus for you: There are seven states of nobility, from which the creature receives being if it disposes itself to all to come to the one that is perfect; and we will tell you how by the end of this book.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 3. Où Amour parle des commandements de Sainte-Eglise

Love: We shall begin here with the commandments of Holy Church, so that everyone may find their nourishment in this book with the help of God, who commands us to love Him with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our strength, to love ourselves as we ought, and to love our neighbor as ourselves.

Firstly, to love Him with all our heart: that is to say, that our thoughts should always be truly on Him; with all our soul: that is to say, that we should never speak anything but the truth, even if it means we must die for it; with all our strength: that we should do all our works purely for Him; ourselves as we ought: that we should not look to our own profit in this, but to the perfect will of God; and our neighbor as ourselves: that we should do, think, or say nothing towards our neighbor that we would not want him to do, think, or say towards us. These commandments are necessary for the salvation of all: without them, no one can find grace.

Note here the example of the young man who said to Jesus Christ that he had kept these commandments since his childhood; Jesus Christ replied to him: "You must do one thing if you wish to be perfect: go, sell all your possessions and give them to the poor; then follow me, and you will have a treasure in heaven." This is the counsel of all perfection in virtues, and whoever adheres to it well will remain in true charity.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 4. De la noble vertu de Charité, et comment elle n’obéit qu’à

Love 1
Love: Charity obeys nothing created, but only Love.
Charity possesses nothing of its own, and if it were to have something, it does not claim it as its own.
Charity leaves its own work to go and do that of others.
Charity asks no reward from any creature, whatever good or pleasure it may do for them.
Charity feels neither shame, nor fear, nor sorrow; it is so upright that it cannot bend, whatever may happen to it.
Charity neither does nor considers anything that is under the sun; the entire world is but its surplus and its remnants.
Charity gives to all that which it has, and it does not hold itself back; and with that, it often promises what it does not have, because of its great generosity, in the hope that more remains for the one who gives more.
Charity is such a wise merchant that it gains everywhere, where others lose, and it escapes the bonds in which others are caught; and thus it has great abundance of that which pleases Love.
And note that the one who would have perfect charity would be put to death by the work of Charity concerning the affections of life according to the spirit.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 5. De la vie qui s’appelle « paix de charité en vie anéantie »

Love: But there is another life, which we call "peace of charity in an annihilated life." It is of this that we wish to speak, asking that one may find
I    a soul
II    that is saved by faith and without works,
III    that is solely in Love,
IV    that does nothing because of God,
V    that forsakes nothing because of God,
VI    to whom nothing can be taught,
VII    from whom nothing can be taken away
VIII    nor given,
IX    and that has no will.
Alas! Who then will give this soul what it needs? For it has neither been given to it nor will it ever be given!
This soul has six wings, like the Seraphim. It no longer desires anything that comes through an intermediary, which is the state proper to the Seraphim: there is no intermediary between their love and divine love. They always receive His message without an intermediary: likewise, this soul receives it, for it does not seek divine knowledge among the masters of this age, but in true contempt of the world and of itself. My God! How great is the difference between a gift that the beloved gives to his beloved through an intermediary, and one that he gives without an intermediary!
This book speaks truly of this soul, in saying that it has six wings like the Seraphim. With two wings it covers the face of Jesus Christ Our Lord; that is to say, the more this soul knows of divine goodness, the more perfectly it knows that it knows nothing in comparison to a single spark of His real goodness, for He is comprehended only by Himself. With two other wings, it covers His feet; that is to say, the more it knows of what Jesus Christ suffered for us, the more perfectly it knows that it knows nothing in comparison to what He really suffered for us, for He is known only by Himself. With two other wings, the soul flies and stands both upright and seated; that is to say, all that it knows, loves, and praises of divine goodness are the wings with which it flies; and it stands upright for it is always under the gaze of God, and seated for it always remains in the divine will.
Yes; and what or how could this soul be afraid? Certainly, it could neither fear nor dread anything: supposing it were in the world and it were possible that the world, the flesh, and the devil, the four elements, the birds of the air, and the wild beasts torment, tear apart, or devour it, it could still lose nothing if God remains with it, for He is wholly everywhere, all-powerful, all wisdom, and all goodness.
The Soul: He is our father, our brother, and our loyal friend. He is without beginning, He is comprehensible only by Himself, He is without end, three persons in one God. Such is the beloved of our souls.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 6. Comment l’âme amoureuse de Dieu, vivant en paix de charité,

Takes Leave of the Virtues
Love: The soul whose love is of this quality can say to the Virtues that she has long and many days been in their servitude.
The Soul: I confess it to you, Lord Love: there was a time when I was, but now it is another; your desire has freed me from their servitude, and that is why I can now say and sing this to them:
Virtues, I take leave of you forever:
My heart will be freer and more joyful for it.
Your service is too constant, I know it.
I once placed my heart in you, without reserve;
You know that I was yours, wholly abandoned:
I was then your slave, now I am delivered.
I had placed my whole heart in you, I know it:
I lived a certain time in great turmoil.
I suffered many grave torments, many endured pains;
It is a wonder that, absolutely, I escaped alive.
But if it is so, I care little: I am weaned from you,
For which I thank the God above; it is a good day!
I have left your prison, where I was in much distress.
Never was I free, except separated from you;
I have left your prison: in peace I remain.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 7. Comment cette âme est noble, et comment elle ne tient compte

Love: This soul takes no account of shame or honor, poverty or wealth, ease or discomfort, love or hatred, hell or paradise.

Reason: In the name of God, what do you mean by what you say?

Love: What do I mean? Indeed, only he to whom God has given understanding knows, and no one else, for neither Scripture contains it, nor human wisdom comprehends it, nor the labor of any creature allows it to be heard or understood. Rather, this gift comes from the Most High, in whom this creature is enraptured by the fullness of knowledge, and nothing remains in its understanding. Thus, this soul, having become nothing, possesses everything and yet possesses nothing, desires everything and desires nothing, knows everything and knows nothing.

Reason: But what can it mean, Lord Love, that this soul can desire what this book says, when it has previously stated that it has no will?

Love: Reason, it is not its own will that desires it, but rather the will of God that desires it within it; for it is not this soul that remains in Love, which would make it desire this by some longing, but rather Love that remains in it, having taken its will, and thus it fulfills its will through it; so Love operates in it without itself, so that no discomfort can remain in it.

This soul can no longer speak of God, for it is annihilated in all its external desires, in its internal way of feeling, and in all affection of spirit, to the extent that it does what it does by the exercise of a good habit or by a commandment of Holy Church, without any desire, for the will that desire gave it is dead.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 8. Comment Raison s’étonne de ce que cette âme ait délaissé les

Virtues, and how Love praises them
Reason, who understands only coarse things and overlooks the finer: Love, what is this marvel? This soul has no sense of grace nor desire for spirit, since it has taken leave of the Virtues that teach every good soul the way to live well. Indeed, without these Virtues, no one can be saved or come to the perfect life, and whoever possesses them cannot be deceived; nevertheless, this soul takes leave of them! But is it not foolish, the soul that speaks thus?
Love: Certainly not! Indeed, such souls possess the Virtues better than any other creature; but they do not practice them, for they no longer belong to them, contrary to their habit: they have been slaves to them enough to be henceforth freed.
Reason: But, Love, when then were they slaves?
Love: When they dwelled in your love and in your obedience, Lady Reason, and also in that of the other Virtues; and by dwelling there, they have been freed from it.
Reason: And when then were these souls freed?
Love: They are freed when Love dwells in them and the Virtues serve them without any contradiction or effort on their part. But assuredly, Reason, the souls that have been thus freed have known on many occasions what Domination can do, and to those who would ask them what is the greatest torment a creature can suffer, they would answer that it is to dwell in Love while being under the obedience of the Virtues. Indeed, it is fitting to give the Virtues all that they ask, whatever it may cost Nature; but it is thus that the Virtues demand honor and possession, heart, body, and life; in other words, while these souls forsake all things, the Virtues still say to the one who has given them all that and has retained nothing to comfort Nature, that with great difficulty the just is saved! So much so that this exhausted soul, still a slave to the Virtues, says that it would rather be governed by Fear and tormented in hell until judgment, if it should then be saved!
This is true. Such is the subjection in which the soul lives upon which the Virtues have power. But the souls of which we speak have put the Virtues in their place, for they do nothing for the Virtues: rather, it is the Virtues that do all that these souls want, without domination or contradiction, for these souls are their mistresses.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 9. Comment ces âmes n’ont point de volonté propre

Love: To anyone who would ask them if they would like to be in purgatory, these free, assured, and peaceful souls would answer no; if they would like to have in this life the certainty of their salvation, they would answer no; or if they would like to be in paradise, they would answer no. But then, what would they want? They have no will, and if they desired anything, they would separate themselves from Love; for the one who holds their will knows what is good for them, and that suffices for them, without knowing and without further assurance. These souls live by knowledge, love, and praise: such is their habitual exercise without moving of themselves, for Knowledge, Love, and Praise dwell within them. These souls cannot find themselves good or bad, and they have no knowledge of themselves nor can they judge whether they are on the right path or the wrong.

Or, to speak more briefly, let us take one soul among all, one that neither desires nor despises poverty and tribulation, mass and sermon, fasting and prayer, and that gives to Nature all that it needs without remorse of conscience: well! this Nature is so well ordered by the transformation of the union of Love to which the will of this soul is joined, that it asks for nothing that is forbidden. This soul does not worry about anything it needs, except at the hour when it is needed; but this worry, no one can lose it unless they are innocent.

Reason: In the name of God, what does this mean?

Love: To this, Reason, I answer you as I have already done, and I tell you once again: no master whose wisdom comes from Nature, nor any master in Scripture, nor any of those who remain in the love of obedience to Virtues, understand it nor will understand it where there is something to understand; be certain of it, Reason, for no one understands it, except only the one who pursues ‹Fin Amour›. Indeed, if by chance such souls were found, they would tell the truth of it if they wished; but do not think that anyone can understand them, except only the one who pursues ‹Fin Amour› and Charity. This gift is sometimes given in an instant: let him who receives it take care, for it is the most perfect gift that God gives to a creature. This soul is in the school of Divinity; thus it sits in the valley of Humility and in the plain of Truth, and it rests on the mountain of Love.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 10. Comment, à la requête de Raison, Amour nomme cette âme par

twelve names for the use of the active

Reason: Well then! Love, name this soul by its rightful name, and give some knowledge of it to the active!

Love: It can be named by twelve names, namely:
the most marvelous; the unknown; the most innocent of the daughters of Jerusalem;
the one upon whom Holy Church is entirely founded; the one illuminated by Knowledge;
the one adorned by Love; the one enlivened by Praise; the one annihilated in all things by humility; the one peaceful in the divine state by divine will; the one who desires nothing other than the divine will; the one who is accomplished and satisfied without any failing by divine goodness, thanks to the operation of the Trinity;
its final name is: Oblivion.
These twelve names, Love gives to it.

Pure Courtesy: But certainly, it is only right that it should be so named, for these are its rightful names.

Reason: There you have it, Love; you have named this soul by many names; by this, the active will gain some knowledge of it, if only by hearing these most noble names.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 11. Comment, à la requête de Raison, Amour donne connaissance

…of this soul to the contemplatives, by explaining nine points previously mentioned
Reason: Now, Love, on behalf of the contemplatives, on behalf of those who always desire to grow in divine knowledge and who are and remain in the desire of Love, I would ask you, by your courtesy, to expound the nine points you have already spoken of, which the soul pursuing Perfect Love possesses, a soul in which Charity dwells and sits in a life annihilated, placing it in the abandonment of Pure Love.
Love: Name them then, Reason!
Reason, to Love: The first point you mentioned is that such a soul cannot be found.
Love: That is true. That is to say, this soul knows within itself only one thing, namely the root of all its evils and the abundance of all its innumerable sins, without weight or measure. But sin is nothing, and this soul is entirely collapsed and terrified by its horrible faults, which are less than nothing; and in understanding this, it becomes less than nothing as far as it depends on itself; from which one can conclude that such a soul cannot be found. Indeed, it is so annihilated by humility that, in its just judgment, if God were to take vengeance for the thousandth part of a single one of its faults, no creature that ever sinned would deserve the torment and infinite confusion it sees itself worthy of. This humility, and no other, is true and perfect humility in the annihilated soul.
The second point is that this soul is saved by faith and without works.
Reason: In the name of God, what does that mean?
Love: It means that this annihilated soul has within itself such great knowledge by the virtue of faith, and it is so occupied within itself with maintaining what Faith administers to it from the power of the Father, the wisdom of the Son, and the goodness of the Holy Spirit, that nothing created can remain in its memory without briefly passing due to this other occupation that has invested its understanding. This soul can no longer perform works; thus it is certainly sufficiently excused and justified, in believing without working that God is immeasurably good. This soul is saved by faith and without works, for Faith surpasses all works, according to the testimony of Love itself.
The third point is that it is alone in Love.
Reason: In the name of God, sire Love, what does that mean?
Love: It means that this soul finds neither comfort, nor affection, nor hope in any creature that God has created, neither in heaven nor on earth, but only in the goodness of God. Such a soul neither begs nor asks anything from creatures. It is like the Phoenix, which is alone, for it is alone in Love, this soul that is self-sufficient.
The fourth point is that this soul does nothing for the sake of God.
Reason: In the name of God, what does that mean?
Love: It means that God has no need of its work, and this soul has no need of anything, except what God has need of. It does not care for itself; let God care for it, who loves it more than it loves itself! It has such great faith in God that it is not afraid of being poor as long as its beloved is rich. Indeed, Faith teaches it that it will find God according to its hope, and as it hopes by its faith that He is perfectly rich, it cannot be poor.
The fifth point is that this soul does not abandon, for the sake of God, anything it can do.
Reason: In the name of God, Love, what does that mean?
Love: It means that it can do nothing other than the will of God; but it cannot want anything else either; and for that reason, it does not abandon anything for the sake of God. Indeed, it does not let anything enter its thought that is opposed to God; and for that reason, it does not abandon anything for the sake of God.
The sixth point is that nothing can be taught to it.
Reason: In the name of God, what does that mean?
Love: It means that this soul is of such great constancy that if it had all the knowledge of all the creatures that ever were, are, and will be, it would seem nothing to it compared to the one it loves, who was never known and never will be. This soul loves more what is in God, which was never given and never will be, than it loves what it has and would have if it were to have all the knowledge that all creatures that are and will be have.
The soul: And yet it is nothing compared to what it really is, but nothing can be said of it.
Love: The seventh point is that nothing can be taken from it.
Reason: In the name of God, Love, tell us what that means!
Love: What does that mean? But what would one take from it? Certainly, nothing could be taken from it, for whoever would take its honor, its wealth and its friends, its heart, its body and its life, would still take nothing from it if God remains with it; from which it follows that nothing can be taken from it, no matter the force applied.
The eighth point is that nothing can be given to it.
Reason: In the name of God, Love, what does that mean, that nothing can be given to it?
Love: What does that mean? But what would one give to it? If one gave it everything that was and ever will be given, it would still be nothing compared to what it loves and will love, except God Himself.
The soul: Sire Love loves and will love in me.
Love: With all due respect, I am not there yet! (To the audience:) We will say that God loves more what surpasses this soul and is in Him, than what does not surpass it and that it is by itself.
The soul replies: But what does not surpass it is not, there is only the whole; and that, I can well say, and thus speak the truth.
Love: I say even more: if this soul had all the knowledge, all the love and all the praise that were and ever will be given by the divine Trinity, it would still be nothing compared to what it loves and will love; but it will never attain this love by way of knowledge.
The soul, to Love: But certainly, dear Love, I will not attain even the slightest point of it without the help of what surpasses my love, for God is none other than the one of whom absolutely nothing can be known. Indeed, He alone is my God, of whom nothing can be said and of whom all the inhabitants of paradise cannot attain even a point, no matter the knowledge they have of Him. And in what thus surpasses Him, resides the greatest mortification of the love of my spirit; and that is now and forever the entire glory of the love of my soul, and that of all those who ever understood themselves. What a small thing it is to listen to, compared to the greatest, of which no one speaks! I would like to speak of it, but I do not know what to say. And yet, sire Love, my love is of such quality,
that I prefer to hear something bad said about you, rather than nothing at all. And that is indeed what I do: I speak ill of you, for everything I say of you is but speaking ill of your goodness; but you must forgive me my slander, for, Sire, he who always speaks of you, even if he never says anything of your goodness, speaks ill of you! That is what happens to me: I never stop speaking of you, in my questions or in my thoughts, or listening if someone tells me something of your goodness; but the more I hear of you, the more astonished I am, for it would be a great insult to consider that I have understood because something was said to me. Indeed, those who believe so are mistaken, for I am certain that nothing can be said of it, and if it pleases God, I will never be mistaken; what I want is never to hear a lie about your divine goodness, but to accomplish the undertaking of this book of which Love is the master, who told me to put an end to all my undertakings in it. Indeed, as long as I question Love about something concerning Him, I will lead a life according to the spirit in the shadow of the sun, where one can see the subtle images of the attractions of divine love of the divine generation.
[To Reason:]
But what am I saying? Suppose I possess everything that was said, it would certainly be nothing compared to what I love of Him, and that He will give to no one but Himself, and that He must keep due to His divine justice. And it is therefore in truth that I say that nothing can be given to me, whatever it may be. But this complaint you hear from me, lady Reason, it is my all and what I have of best, if one understands well. Ah! How sweet it is to understand! My God! Understand it fully, for paradise is nothing other than that.
Love: The ninth point, lady Reason, is that this soul has no will.
Reason: God of love! What are you saying? You say that this soul has no will?
Love: But certainly, for everything this soul wills by consenting, is what God wills it to will, and it wills it to accomplish the will of God and not its own; and it cannot will it by itself, but it is the will of God that wills it in it; from which it follows that this soul has no will without the will of God that makes it will everything it must will.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 12. La véritable façon de comprendre ce que ce livre dit en bien des

Love: Now, listen and understand well, readers of this book, the true way to comprehend what it says in many places, namely that the annihilated soul has no will, nor can it have one, nor can it desire to have one, and in this the divine will is perfectly accomplished; it also says that the soul is not satisfied with divine love nor is divine love satisfied with the soul, as long as the soul is not in God nor God in the soul, by itself and through itself; and in this divine manner of being, the soul then finds all its satisfaction.

Understanding of Reason: It is true, but it seems that the ninth point says the exact opposite, for it says that the annihilated soul does not want anything besides what it would want to want; and this desire, it cannot have, for God wants it to desire that its desire be nothing compared to that which would satisfy it, which will never be given to it.

Reason: I understand from this that the soul wants to desire and that God wants it to desire a desire that it cannot have, and from this comes its failing and lack of satisfaction.

Understanding of Reason: It seems to me, sire Love, that this ninth point makes me understand this by contradicting this book, for it holds as true that the liberated soul has no will, nor can it have one, nor can it desire one, and that the divine Unity does not want it to have one, and that it thus has in all things—according to this book—full satisfaction through divine love.

The Annihilated Soul: Hold on! Understanding of Reason, you are taking it too easily! You keep the chaff and leave the grain! Indeed, your understanding is too low, and you cannot comprehend with enough elevation the state of which we speak. But the Understanding of Divine Love, which dwells and remains in the annihilated and liberated soul, understands this well, and without obstacle, for it is in that state.

His Highness the Understanding of Love: Now, Understanding of Reason, comprehend the crudeness of your misunderstanding: if this annihilated soul desires the will of God—and the more it desires it, the more it would want to desire it—yet it cannot have it, because of its smallness as a creature, for God keeps the greatness of His divine justice. And yet, God wants it to desire this and to have this desire, and this desire is the divine will that gives its state to the free creature. This divine will that God makes it desire draws into it the waves of divine knowledge, and the marrow of divine love, and the union of divine praise, whereas the will of the soul stops them.

Love: Also, how could the soul have a desire, since Clear Knowledge knows that there is a state among all, the noblest of all, that the creature cannot possess except by desiring nothing?

Now, Reason has heard the answer to its questions, except to the one where it says that the liberated soul remains unsatisfied; and that is why I will tell it what this dissatisfaction consists of: it is to desire the divine will, for the more one desires it, the less one finds satisfaction in it. And yet, this very desire is the only desire of God and the glory of the soul.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 13. Comment Raison est satisfaite de l’explication des choses

...aforementioned for the contemplatives and the active, but it still raises questions for common people.
Reason: Now, Love, you have condescended to our prayer, that is to say, you have explained the aforementioned things for the active and the contemplative; but I would still ask you to explain them for common people, some of whom may eventually reach this state. Indeed, there are several ambiguous words that are difficult for their understanding, and if you explained them, this book would show everyone the true light of truth and the perfection of charity, and also who are those whom God jealously chooses, calls, and loves supremely.
Love: Reason, where then are these ambiguous words that you ask me to distinguish and explain for the benefit of those for whom you make such a humble request, and also for those who will hear this book that we will call: "Mirror of Simple Souls Who Remain in Will and Desire"?
Reason: I answer you, sire Love, that this book says very surprising things about this soul when it declares — it is in chapter seven — that this soul takes no account of shame or honor, poverty or wealth, ease or discomfort, love or hate, hell or paradise. And with that, it declares that this soul has everything and has nothing, knows everything and knows nothing, wants everything and wants nothing, as it says above in chapter nine, so that it desires neither contempt nor poverty, nor martyrdom nor tribulations, nor masses nor sermons, nor fasts nor prayers, and that it gives to Nature everything she asks without remorse of conscience. Surely, Love, no one can understand this by my way of understanding, but it is from you that one learns it, thanks to your teaching. Indeed, according to my way of understanding, in my opinion and to give you my clear advice, the best I would advise would be to desire contempt, poverty, and tribulations of all kinds, masses and sermons, fasts and prayers, to fear all kinds of loves, whatever they may be, because of the dangers that may be found in them, to desire supremely paradise and to fear hell, to refuse all kinds of honors, temporal things and everything that brings ease, taking from Nature what she asks, except only what she could not live without, following the example of the suffering and passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ. This is what I can say and advise best to all those who live under my obedience. And yet, I say to all that no one will understand this book by my way of understanding, but it must be understood by the virtue of Faith and by the strength of Love who are my masters, for I obey them totally. I would even say more: whoever has these two strings to his bow — namely the light of Faith and the strength of Love — has permission to do whatever he pleases, according to the testimony of Love himself who says to the soul: "Beloved, love and do what you will!"
Love: Reason, you are very wise and very sure of what belongs to you, in wanting to have an answer to the above words. But since you have asked me to explain what this means, I will answer all your questions. I assure you, Reason: these souls governed by Pure Love, consider shame as much as honor and honor as much as shame, poverty as much as wealth and wealth as much as poverty, the torments of God and his creatures as much as the comfort of God and his creatures, being loved as much as being hated and being hated as much as being loved, being in hell as much as being in paradise and being in paradise as much as being in hell, a modest condition as much as a more advantageous one and a more advantageous one as much as one that depends on her. Truth knows this well, and she also knows that they neither want nor do not want any of these prosperities or adversities, for these souls have no other will than what God wills in them, and the divine will does not burden these exceptional creatures with the troubles we have just mentioned.
I have just said that these souls consider all the adversities of the heart — for the body as well as for the soul — as much as prosperity, and prosperity: why does this book say that this soul possesses everything and yet possesses nothing? This is true if they come to them without their will being the cause; also these souls do not know what is best for them, nor in what way God wants to procure their salvation or that of their neighbor, nor on what occasion God wants to do justice or mercy, nor on what occasion God wants to give the soul the exceptional gifts he makes in the goodness of his divine nobility. And that is why the liberated soul has no will to want or not to want, but only to want the will of God and to endure in peace the divine dispositions.
Reason: Sire Love, I add one more thing to my question of truth, for this soul possesses God by divine grace, and whoever possesses God possesses everything; and yet, it says that she possesses nothing, because everything that this soul possesses in her of God by the gift of divine grace seems nothing to her: this is compared to what she loves and which is in Him, and this, he will give to no one else but Himself. And according to this way of understanding, this soul possesses everything and yet possesses nothing, she knows everything and yet knows nothing...

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 14. Comment cette âme connaît Dieu par la foi 1

Love: This soul knows, by the virtue of faith, that God is all-powerful, that He is all wisdom and perfect goodness, and that God the Father brought about the incarnation, as did the Son and the Holy Spirit. She also knows that God the Father united human nature to the person of God the Son, and that God the Son united it to His own person, and that the Holy Spirit united it to the person of God the Son, so that the Father possesses in Himself a single nature, namely the divine nature, that the person of the Son possesses in Himself three natures, namely the same nature as that of the Father, the nature of the soul, and the nature of the body, while being a single person in the Trinity, and that the Holy Spirit possesses in Himself this same divine nature that the Father and the Son possess. To believe, to say, to think this, that is true contemplation: one power, one knowledge, one will, one God in three persons and three persons in one God. This God is everywhere according to His divine nature, but His humanity is only in paradise in glory, united to the person of the Son, as well as in the sacrament of the altar.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 15. Où l’on parle du Saint-Sacrement de l’autel1

Love: Christians receive this divinity and humanity when they approach the Holy Sacrament of the altar. To what extent this humanity remains in them, faith teaches and the clerics know.

Light of Faith: And that is why we will make an assumption to better understand this sacrament. Take this sacrament, put it in a mortar with something else, and grind it until you can no longer see or sense the person you placed in it.

Faith: Truly, I tell you, it is no longer there. You may then ask, "Has it departed?"

Truth: No. It was there, but now it is no longer there (understand this correctly, and not in a human way). You may then wonder if it has returned as it came, but I tell you that the humanity of Jesus Christ does not come and go.

Temptation: What can this mean?

Truth: It was there when it could be seen and felt; but now, it is no longer there since it can neither be seen nor felt: thus has divine power ordained. And this very humanity that is in the sacrament of the altar is not seen under another appearance; neither the angels, nor the saints, nor the Virgin Mary see it differently than we do, and if they see it in the appearance we see it, it is through spiritual understanding, for to see the glorified humanity of Jesus Christ in the sacrament of the altar does not belong to the state of those who are in glory. And that is why they do not see it glorified there, except through understanding.

The soul whose faith is illuminated by the divine Trinity: And we see it there by the virtue of faith, rejecting the reasoning according to our senses which see only bread, neither feeling nor savoring anything else, nor receiving its scent. But our faith rejects them all, for it firmly believes without doubt that there is neither whiteness, nor scent, nor flavor, but that it is the precious body of Jesus Christ, true God and true man. We see it there by faith, which those in glory do not — for what is in glory does not exercise faith — and that is why they do not see it as we do. And the divine Trinity has arranged the Holy Sacrament of the altar in this state to feed, nourish, and sustain Holy Church. Such is the disposition of the sacrament of the altar by divine power, according to the knowledge of God and according to what I believe.

Courtesy of the Goodness of Love: Do not marvel if we tell you these things out of love, for I can well tell you without reproach, that no one can achieve a deep foundation or a high edifice without the subtlety of great natural wisdom and the finesse of the light of spiritual understanding. And for this, one cannot know too much in seeking the divine will. Indeed, the understanding that gives light shows by its nature to the soul what it loves; and the soul, receiving the closeness and union through the light of understanding, and the state to which it tends to find its foundation and rest through the concord of a union in abundant love, willingly listens to the knowledge and light that bring news of its love; indeed, it comes from Love, and that is why it wants to be returned there to have only one will in love: the sole will of the one it loves.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 16. Où Amour répond à Raison sur ce qu’il a dit que l'âme sait tout

Love: Reason, regarding what I said about the liberated soul knowing everything and yet knowing nothing, I answer you that it knows by the virtue of faith what it needs to know for its salvation; and yet it knows nothing of what God possesses in it, of himself and for it, and which he will give to no one else but it. And so, in this way of understanding, this soul knows everything and yet knows nothing.

It wills everything, and yet it wills nothing: indeed, this soul so perfectly wills the will of God that it neither knows, nor can, nor wills anything else in its will but the will of God, so strongly has Love imprisoned it; and yet, it wills nothing, for what it wills and what God wills in it is so little compared to what it would want to will, that it cannot have what God wills it to will. Indeed, its will is nothing compared to what would satisfy it and which will never be given to it: this is the will of the will of God, as has already been said. And so, in this way of understanding, this soul wills everything and yet wills nothing.

This daughter of Zion desires neither masses nor sermons, neither fasts nor prayers.

Reason: And why, sire Love? Yet these are the sustenance of holy souls!

Love: This is true for those who beg, but this one begs for nothing, for it has no need to desire anything outside of itself. Now, Reason, understand: why would this soul desire the things I have just named, since God is as well everywhere without them as with them? This soul has no other thought, word, or deed, but the exercise of the grace of the divine Trinity. It feels no sorrow for the sins it ever committed, nor for the sufferings of God for it, nor for the sins or the evils in which its neighbor remains.

Reason: God! But what does this mean, Love? Teach me how to understand it, since you have satisfied me on my other questions.

Love: It means that this soul does not belong to itself, so much so that it cannot feel sorrow, for its thought is established in a peaceful place, and that is in the Trinity; it cannot move from it nor feel sorrow as long as its Beloved is well. But should someone fall into sin, and that sin was ever committed, this displeases its will as it does God's, for it is this very displeasure that gives this soul its displeasure. Nevertheless, the Trinity feels no sorrow in it for this displeasure, so that this soul established in it feels none either. Indeed, if this soul established so high could help its neighbor, it would help with all its power in what is needed; but the thoughts of such souls are so divine that they do not dwell so much on transient and created things that they conceive sorrow for them, since God is immeasurably good.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 17. Où Amour répond à Raison

On what he said about these souls giving to Nature what she asks for:
Love: This soul gives to Nature as much as she asks; it is true that this soul does not put so much care or love into temporal things that she might gain by refusing them to her; rather, she would feel scrupulous about taking away what belongs to her. However, these creatures are so excellent that one dares not speak openly about them, especially about their practice; through it, these souls are in a state to understand properly, but few are those who taste this way of understanding.

I just said that one dares not speak openly: certainly, one should not, because of the simplistic way of understanding of other creatures, for fear that by misunderstanding, they might be harmed.

The souls such as those this book speaks of, in touching upon something of their practice, are in such a condition, in the direct line of their state, a pure and divine state, that if they had nothing, even being certain of having to live until Judgment, they could not for a single moment take to heart anything that they lack, for all the gold in the world, except only to the extent that Nature needs what is necessary and to give her what belongs to her. And if such souls had something—few people know where they are, but there must be some by the just goodness of Love, to support the faith of Holy Church—, if they had something knowing that others need it more than they do, they would not retain it in any case, even if they were then certain that the earth would never again bear bread, wheat, or other sustenance. And this is the truth, let no one doubt it!

Such is its nature by pure justice,
And this justice is divine justice,
Which has given its measure to this soul.
Divine justice: It is just. All justice must be accomplished in them. And if they retained what is necessary for their neighbor, they would retain what does not belong to them according to the perfection of the peace of charity in which they live completely, for it is the nourishment proper to them. But on the other hand, why should these souls feel scrupulous about taking what they need when necessity demands it? It would be for them a lack of innocence and an obstacle to the peace in which the soul rests from all things. Who then should feel scrupulous about taking what he needs from the four elements that are the clarity of the sky, the warmth of the fire, the dew of the water, and the earth that supports us? We use these four elements in all the ways that Nature needs, without reproach from Reason. These gracious elements are made by God like the rest. Thus, these souls use everything that is made and created and that Nature needs, in perfect peace of heart, as they do the earth on which they walk.

Love: They have a solid foundation and a lofty edifice, which keeps them at rest from all things.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 18. Comment ces créatures ne peuvent plus parler de Dieu

The soul: These creatures can no longer speak of God, for just as they cannot say where God is, they cannot say who God is. Indeed, whoever speaks of God whenever he wishes, to whom he wishes, and wherever he wishes to speak, must know without any doubt that he has never felt the true heart of divine love, for this seizes the soul amidst everyone without her noticing. Indeed, the true and refined heart of divine love is without creaturely matter, and it is given from creator to creature; and these souls are accustomed to understanding much and forgetting everything because of the subtlety of their lover.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 19. Comment Foi, Espérance et Charité demandent à Amour la

Knowledge of these souls
Faith, Hope, and Charity: O Holy Trinity, where are the exceptional souls like those spoken of in this book? Who are they? And where are they? And what do they do? Show them to us, by Love who knows all, and those who are moved by hearing this book will find peace! Indeed, the entire Holy Church would marvel if she heard it read!
Faith: It is true.
Love: It is true of Holy Church the Lesser! The Church governed by Reason; but not of Holy Church the Greater, which is governed by us!
Love, to the three theological Virtues: But then, why do you ask us who they are, and where they are, and what they do? Surely, if you do not know, nothing that God has created could find them! But where they are, you all three know, for you are with them at every hour, since it is you three who ennoble them. And what they do, you know as well.
However, who they are—if we speak of their worth and dignity—neither you nor they know, so much so that Holy Church cannot know.
Reason: In the name of God, who then knows?
Love: Only the one who created and redeemed them, and perhaps recreated them many times, for the sole love of whom they are exiled, annihilated, and forgotten.
How then does Holy Church marvel that the Virtues serve these high celestial souls? Why would they not? Are not the Virtues all praised, prescribed, and ordained for these souls, and not these souls for the Virtues? So much so that these Virtues are made to serve these souls, while these souls are made to obey God and to receive the singular gifts of the pure courtesy of his divine nobility, gifts that God does not bestow on any creature dwelling in desire and will. Thus, whoever wishes to possess these gifts must be accompanied neither by desire nor by will, for otherwise, they will not possess them.
And why would Holy Church know these queens, daughters, sisters, and wives of the king? For Holy Church to know them perfectly would mean she would be within their soul; but no created thing enters there, except the one who created them, so that no one knows these souls, except God who is within them.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 20. Amour répond à Raison sur ce qu'il a dit que personne ne

Who knows these souls, if not God?
Reason: Yes, Love, but with all due respect, I must ask another question, and I would be surprised if you did not answer it.
Love, to Reason: Very well. Tell me, what is your question?
Reason: I will tell you. This book declares that no one knows these souls, except God who is within them. Yet, it previously said that no one can find or know them, except those who pursue ‹Fin Amour›, but that whoever finds them would speak the truth about them; this is what the book said earlier. From this, it seems that those who are such know those who are likewise, provided they have been where they are.
Love: That is true, for those who are such, provided they have been where they are, would know their companions by their practice, but even more so by the strength of the gift that is given to them and which is unique.
Reason: Unique! Indeed! For hearing this, I am singularly amazed.
Love: Reason, the same word can be understood in two ways. Indeed, if those who are such know the practice of these souls, and this is the most perfect state that God gives to a creature, they do not, however, know their dignity, for God alone knows it, He who created them.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 21. Amour répond au blâme de Raison, à propos de ce que ce livre

Reason: Now, Love, I pose another question to you. Indeed, this book says that this soul takes leave of the Virtues in all that it does, whereas you say that the Virtues are always with these souls, more perfectly than with any other: these seem to me to be two contradictory statements; I cannot understand them.

Love: I shall clarify this for you. It is true that this soul has taken leave of the Virtues in terms of their practice and the desire for what they demand; but the Virtues have not taken leave of it, for they are always with it, perfectly obeying it. And in this way of understanding, this soul takes leave of them, and yet they are always with it.

Indeed, if a man serves a master, he belongs to the one he serves, but his master does not belong to him; however, it sometimes happens that this servant gains and learns so much with his master that he becomes richer and wiser than him, so much so that he leaves him to find a better one. And when the one who was his master sees that the one who was his servant is certainly worth more and knows more than he does, he stays with him to obey him in all things. This is exactly how you can and should understand what is said about the Virtues and these souls. Indeed, at the beginning, no matter the cost to heart and body, this soul did everything that Reason taught it, which was its mistress, and Reason always told it to do everything the Virtues wanted, without contradiction and until death, so much so that Reason and the other Virtues were mistresses of this soul, and this soul was truly obedient to everything they wanted to command because it wanted to live a spiritual life. Now, it is thus that this soul has gained and learned so much with the Virtues that it is now above them; indeed, it has within itself all that the Virtues can teach, and more, incomparably more, for this soul possesses within itself the master of the Virtues, who is called Divine Love, who has completely transformed it into himself and united it with himself, so that it no longer belongs to itself nor to the Virtues.

Reason: And to whom then does it belong?

Love: To my will, which has transformed it into me.

Reason: But who are you, Love? Are you not one of the Virtues along with us, even admitting that you are above us?

Love: I am God, for Love is God and God is Love, and this soul is God by the condition of love; I am God by divine nature, and this soul is by the justice of love, so that my tender and beloved is taught and guided by me without itself, for it is transformed into me.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 22. Comment cette âme est comparée à l’aigle, et comment elle

Takes leave of Nature
Love: This soul is compared to the eagle because it flies high, very high, even higher than any bird, for it is feathered with Pure Love. It gazes in all its clarity at the beauty of the sun, its ray, and their splendor, which gives it as nourishment the marrow of the high cedar.
The soul, to the unfortunate Nature that made it dwell many days in servitude: Lady Nature, I take leave of you: Love is near me, I stand in freedom thanks to him, without fear and before all.
Love: This soul is not frightened by tribulation, nor does it linger in consolation, nor is it troubled by temptation, nor diminished by any deprivation. It is common to all in the largesse of pure charity; thus it asks nothing of anyone, because of the noble courtesy of the pure goodness with which God has filled it. It is at all times serious without sadness and joyful without dissolution, for in it, God has sanctified His name, and the divine Trinity makes its home there.
You others, the little ones, you who find your nourishment in will and desire, desire to be such, for whoever can desire the least and does not desire the most, is not worthy that God should give him the least of His goods, because of the cowardice to which he lets himself fall in his poor courage, so that he is always seen hungry.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 23. Comment cette âme a deux piliers, et comment elle est ivre de

Love: This liberated soul rests upon two pillars, one to the right and the other to the left. Thanks to these two pillars, the soul stands strong against its enemies, like a castle on a mound surrounded by the sea, impossible to undermine. One of these pillars, which keeps the soul strong against its enemies and preserves the gifts that constitute its wealth, is the true knowledge it has of its own poverty. The left pillar, on which it leans at all times, is strength, and the right one is the elevated knowledge it receives from pure Divinity.

The soul is supported by these two pillars, so much so that it pays no heed to its enemies, neither to the right nor to the left; indeed, it is so seized by the knowledge of its poverty that it appears utterly astonished in the eyes of the world and in its own. And it is so intoxicated by the knowledge of the love and grace of pure Divinity that it is always drunk with knowledge and filled with the praises of divine love; and not only drunk with what it has drunk, but entirely drunk and more than drunk with what it has never drunk and never will drink.

Reason: In the name of God, Love, what does it mean that this soul is drunk with what it has never drunk and never will drink? It seems, from what I can understand of these words, that there is more to intoxicate this soul in what its beloved drinks, has drunk, or will drink of the divine beverage of his own goodness, than in what it has drunk or will drink from that same cask.

Love: That is correct. It is what surpasses it that makes it drunk, even though it has not drunk any of it, as it is said; and yet, yes! it has drunk because its beloved has drunk, for between him and it, through the transformation of love, there is no difference, regardless of their natures. Love operates in it through justice this transformation that has intoxicated it with what, in its drink, surpasses it, and it will never be otherwise.

It often happens that there are several taps on a cask, but the clearest, newest, most beneficial, most delightful, and most intoxicating wine is the wine from the top tap, the sovereign drink that no one drinks except the Trinity. And from this drink, without drinking it, the annihilated soul, the liberated soul, the forgotten soul is drunk, entirely drunk and more than drunk, even though it has never drunk it and never will.

Now, listen and understand if you desire further explanation. In this cask of divine drink, there are indeed several taps: humanity united to the person of the Son of God knows this, for it drinks from the noblest tap after the Trinity; the Virgin Mary drinks from the next, and this noble lady is drunk from the highest; and after her, it is the ardent Seraphim who drink, on whose wings these free souls fly.

Holy Church: My God! How purely must one love, and with what refinement must one care for a soul that soars so high!

Love: This soul is an abyss through the humility of its memory, understanding, and will, and its knowledge is very piercing through its subtlety, and it is everywhere very free through the love of Divinity.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 24. En quel temps ces âmes sont en la droite liberté de Pur Amour

Reason: Well then, Love, when are these souls in the true freedom of Pure Love?

Love: When they have no desire, nor feel in any way, nor the slightest affection of spirit at any moment; indeed, such an exercise would enslave them, because it is too far from the peace of freedom, to which few people surrender. Thus, they do nothing that is against the peace of their inner state, and thus they bear in peace the dispositions of Love.

The people who live this are in such fullness that they have the divine sun within them, without begging outside, and thereby they can keep the purity of heart; and no one else has knowledge of what surpasses them; and if they had no knowledge of it, they could beg from what does not surpass them, but they could not be satisfied thus.

These souls are alone in all things and common in all things, for they do not lose the freedom of their state, whatever may happen to them. Indeed, just as the sun receives the clarity of God and shines on all things without contracting any impurity, so these souls receive their state from God and in God without contracting impurity, whatever they see or hear outside themselves.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 25. Raison demande à Amour si ces âmes sentent quelque joie en

Reason: But tell me, Love: do these souls feel any joy within themselves or outside of themselves?

Love: I answer no to your question; indeed, their nature is killed and their spirit is dead, for all will has separated from them, and that is why it lives, it remains, and it is in the divine will, due to this killing. Now, Reason, listen, to better understand what you have asked! One who burns does not feel cold, and one who drowns does not feel thirst. Now, this soul is so burning in the furnace of the fire of love that it has become fire, strictly speaking, so that it does not feel the fire, since it is fire in itself by the force of Love that has transformed it into the fire of love. This fire goes out of itself and burns by itself in all places and at all times without consuming any matter, nor being able to want to consume anything other than what comes from itself. Indeed, whoever feels God through a matter that he sees or hears outside of himself or by his own effort, that one is not entirely fire, but rather there is matter mixed with this fire: the effort of man, the desire to have matter outside of oneself so that the love of God may grow within, this is but a blindness to the knowledge of God's goodness; whereas one who burns with this fire without seeking matter, without having it and without wanting to have it, that one sees so clearly in all things, that he appreciates them at their true worth. Indeed, this soul has no matter within it that would prevent it from seeing clearly, since it is alone in itself by the virtue of true humility, it is common to all by the largesse of perfect charity, and alone in God by the divine undertaking of ‹Fin Amour›.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 26. Comment cette âme n’aime rien, sinon pour l’amour de Dieu

Love: This soul neither loves nor will love anything in God, however noble it may be, except solely for God and because He wills it; thus will she love God in all things and things for the love of Him; and through this love, this soul is solely in the pure love of the love of God. Her knowledge is so clear that she sees herself as nothingness in God, and sees God as nothingness in her.
Now, noble lovers, understand what remains to be understood through meditation of love, without listening to it from a creature, for this meditation that the soul borrows from Love — without desiring any of its gifts which are called consolations and which comfort the soul by making it feel the sweetness of prayer — teaches it, and no other exercise does, but pure love. Indeed, he who would desire the comforts of God by feeling some consolation would hinder the undertaking of ‹Fin Amour›.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 27. Comment Méditation-d’Amour-Pur n’a qu’une seule intention

Love: Meditation-of-Pure-Love has but one intention, which is to love always loyally without seeking any reward; and this, the soul can only do without itself, for Loyal Love would not deign to receive any consolation that comes from its own acquisition, that is certain.

Meditation-of-Love knows well that the best is to dispense with nothing other than its own work, and to perfectly desire the will of God; and it lets God work and dispose of its will, for one whose will is that the will of God be done in making him feel His comforts, that one would not trust perfectly in His goodness alone, but in the gifts of the riches He can give.

The Soul: And certainly, one who would love well, would neither remember to take nor to ask, but would rather always wish to give without holding back in order to love loyally, for one who has two intentions in a single operation, one would weaken the other. And that is why Loyal Love has but one intention, and it is to always love loyally, for it does not doubt at all that its lover will do the best in his love, provided that he does what he must do; thus it desires nothing, except that the will of God be done in him.

Love: He is right, for everything lies therein; thus this soul can desire nothing of its own power, for its will is not its own nor within itself, but rather in the one who loves it; and this is not its operation, but rather that of the entire Trinity which operates in this soul according to its will.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 28. Comment cette âme nage en l’océan de Joie

Love: This soul swims in the ocean of Joy, that is to say, in the ocean of delights that flow and stream from the Divinity, and thus it feels no joy, for it is joy itself, and thus it swims and flows in joy without feeling any joy, for it dwells in Joy and Joy dwells in it: it is joy itself by the power of Joy which has transformed it into itself. There is now a common will between the lover and the beloved: they are like fire and flame, for Love has transformed this soul into itself.
The soul: Yes, very sweet pure and divine Love, what a sweet transformation it is to be transformed into what I love more than myself! And I am so transformed that I have lost my name to love, I who can love so little: it is in Love that I am transformed, for I love no one other than Love.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 29. Raison demande à Amour à quel moment cette âme est en la

Pure Freedom of Love
Reason: Now, Lord Love, I would ask you to explain what you mean by declaring that this soul is in the true freedom of Pure Love, when it does nothing that is opposed to the peace demanded by its inner state.
Love: I will explain what this means: it is that she does nothing, whatever may happen, that is against the perfect peace of her spirit. Thus acts the true innocent, and the state we are discussing is true innocence.
Reason, I will give you an example: look at a child—who is a pure innocent—; does he do or refrain from doing something, little or much, if it does not please him?
Reason: No, certainly, Love, I can well understand that; and with that, I am satisfied with this question.

speaking of God all that he could say and declare about Him.

Reason: Well then! Lord Love, I beg you to satisfy this soul by at least saying all that can be said about Him who is wholly present in all things.

Love: She knows this, for she always finds Him there, that is, in all things; indeed, one must seek a thing where it is, and since He is everywhere, this soul finds Him everywhere. And for that reason, all things are fitting for her, for she finds nothing anywhere without finding God there. Now, why do you want me to satisfy this soul by speaking of God all that can be said about Him?

Reason: It is so that she may rest peacefully in her state of innocence, without having any reason to stir or move to hear talk of you.

Love, to Reason: I will gladly tell you. I assure you, Reason, and I guarantee it on myself: all that this soul has heard about God and all that can be said about Him is nothing, strictly speaking, compared to what He is in Himself—and this has neither been said nor will ever be said—rather than all that has been said about Him ever having been said, and one could cease speaking of Him. (And yet, Love continues to speak to the soul to increase her joy and her pain, and to satisfy her in all her endeavors:) Soul, Madam, I declare this to you once and for all—and please do not ask me for more, for it would be a wasted effort—all creatures, without exception, who remain and will remain in the vision of the sweet face of your spouse, have grasped and will grasp less of Him, compared to His dignity or what there is to know, to love, to praise about Him and what He Himself knows, rather than one could truly say that one knows, loves, or praises anything about Him.

The Soul: Alas, alas! Love, what am I to do then? Truly, I have never believed anything more than what you are telling me now, but, Lord Love, there is one thing I would say to you, if I could.

Love: So be it! dear soul, say what you please, I am willing to listen.

The Soul, astonished: Well then! dearest Love, tell me, in the name of God: why did He take such care to create me, to redeem me, and to recreate me if it is to give me so little, He who has so much to give? Truly, one does not dare speak of what He intends to do... I really do not know, but if it were such that I could give something, I would not give Him such a small portion, I who am nothing while He is everything; indeed, if I had something to give, I could not keep anything for myself and not give it all to Him. Besides, of the little that I have, I have kept nothing for myself, neither my body, nor my heart, nor my soul, and He knows it well! And now that I have given Him everything, I who have nothing to give, it is clear that I would give Him everything I had, if I had anything to give! Now, He has taken all that I had, He has given me nothing, and He has kept everything; in the name of God, Love, tell me! is this a portion worthy of a beloved?

Love: Well then! dear soul, you know more than you say. If you have given Him everything, it is the best that could happen to you! And yet you give Him nothing that is not His before you gave it to Him. So, see: what are you doing for Him then?

The Soul: You speak the truth, dear Love; I can neither deny it nor wish to...

spouse everything she had
Love: Well then, dearest soul, what do you wish him to give you? Besides, are you not a creature? Would you wish to receive from your beloved something that it is neither fitting for him to give nor for you to receive? Calm yourself, dear soul, if you trust me, for he gives a creature nothing other than what you have, and this gift he gives as befits you.
The soul: Yes, Lord Love, but you did not speak to me like this on the day I made your acquaintance! Indeed, you told me that between beloved and lover, there was no lordship; yet there is, it seems to me, since one has everything and the other has nothing beside that everything! But if I could arrange it, I would, for if I could as much as you can, I would love you as much as you are worth.
Love: Look! dearest soul, you can no longer speak! Calm yourself! Your will suffices for your beloved. He orders you through me to trust in him, and he orders me to tell you that he will love nothing without you, nor will you love anything without him. This is a very beautiful privilege, and let it suffice for you, dear soul, if you trust me.
The soul: In the name of God, Lord Love, be silent! For on this matter I certainly could not remain silent, even if the whole world were to be saved; indeed, I have nothing that I love more strongly than what suffices me, for if what I love did not suffice me, I would fall into decline and decay, as much as I have little love. And yet, Lord Love, one thing alone suffices me, and I will tell you, it is that the one I love more than myself—and I love nothing else except for him—has within him that which you told me no one knows except himself. And so, since I love him more than myself and he is the sum of all goods, my lord, my God, and my all, he is my entire comfort. And thus, if I am desolate because I lack him, I am nonetheless comforted by the fact that he lacks nothing, for he has within him the abundance of all goods, without any lack; and this is all my peace and the true rest of my mind, for I love only for him. And so, since I love only for him, I lack nothing, whatever I may have said before: it is certain, for those who understand well, and what I wanted was to speak of him, since no one spoke to me about him when I would have gladly heard about him. But Lord Love has told me the truth: it is that on this matter, I calm myself, since the best that could be said to me is nothing compared to what is in him. And I did not need to hear more about him than what has been said to me, namely that my beloved cannot be grasped. And it is true, for one could not even grasp the smallest thing that is comparable to him, so much so that my love, however great it may be, would not have found an end to its love by always receiving new love from the one who is all love.
This is all that can be said to me, and nothing would have appeased me, except what Love has said about himself. That is why I say to all that the sum of my questions comes down to the fact that nothing can be said to me about him; and such is the beloved of my soul.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 32. Comment Amour fait durer ces âmes en leur sens

Discernment: In the name of God, think for a moment! How can these souls endure in their sense?

The Soul: I know it well! Love makes them endure! He is the master in this work! I have just said that nothing is lacking to me since my beloved is self-sufficient by his just nobility, without beginning or end. I do not love myself, and I love him and his works only for him alone; thus what he has, and which I neither have nor will ever have, is more mine than what I have and will have in my possession through him.

Reason: Prove it then!

The Soul: It is easy to prove; here is the proof: I love a hundred thousand times more the abundance of goods that remain in him than the gifts I receive and will receive from him in possession. And because I love more what is in him beyond my understanding than what is in him and within my understanding, what he knows and I do not know is more mine than what I know of him and which is mine, for where there is that which surpasses me in my love, there is that which surpasses me in my treasure. And because I love more what in him surpasses me and which I will never know, than what does not surpass me and which I will know, what I love more is mine, by reason of what surpasses me in my love, according to the testimony of Love itself. Such is the fulfillment of my love according to the spirit.

And moreover, Lord Love, I want to say this: if it were possible that one of his creatures received from him the power and will to give me joy and glory, that she received it alone as much as all those who are in his court, but without him giving it to me personally, I would refuse it now and forever rather than accept or want to accept it from another than him: no, truly! Rather eternal death! Besides, I could not, since he has bound me so much to him that I cannot want anything without him.

Dear Love, in the name of God, bear with me, for I am entirely seized because of my beloved, so much so that I do not know what to ask. And what would I ask about him? I know truly that, no more than one could count the waves of the sea in a great wind, no one can describe or say what the spirit grasps, however little and small it grasps something of God; and that is no wonder, for the body is too coarse to speak of the graspings of the spirit. And yet, it is commonly said that something bitter is better than nothing at all: so I tell you likewise that it is better to hear what is described and said about it, than to hear nothing at all.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 33. L’âme s’étonne lorsqu’elle pense aux dons de la bonté de Dieu

The soul [to God]: But how, Lord, have I remained in my right mind when I have thought of the gifts of your goodness, since you have given my soul the vision of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and it will have it without end? Since I will see something as great as the Trinity, the knowledge of the angels, the souls, and the saints will not be taken from me, nor the vision of the small things, that is, all the things lesser than God! Yes, Lord, what have you done for me? Truly, I am entirely seized by what I know of it, to the point that I do not know what to marvel at, and I have no other occupation nor can I have any other as long as this knowledge lasts. If only, Lord, I had no other occasion to marvel than this: you have given my soul the vision of the entire Trinity, of the angels and the souls—what you have not given to your precious body, united to the nature of the Father in the person of the Son, so that I marvel at being able to live still—...; but there is more, Lord: while it is already such a great thing to see the angels and the souls to whom you have given the vision of your sweet face, while these angels and souls, no body is capable of seeing them, and all the more no body can see the Trinity since it cannot see the angels or the souls, nevertheless, you have given this to my spirit, forever and for as long as you are God.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 34. Comment l’âme dit qu’elle ne peut rien d’elle-même

The Soul: In the name of God, Love, I beseech you to tell me what I should do, I who know this and who know the gifts of my beloved's goodness.
Love: I will tell you, but do not ask me for more. And the best I can tell you is that if you perfectly know your nothingness, you will do nothing, and this nothing will give you everything. But if you cannot come to perfectly know your nothingness—which, in truth, is all that is truly yours—then you must do something, and as best as you can, lest you fall back from what you have conceived in your mind. If God has transformed you into Himself, you must not forget your nothingness, that is, you must not forget who you were when He created you in the beginning, and what you would be if He had considered your works, and who you are and would be if there were not in you what is of Him.
The Soul [to God]: Yes, Lord, I am certain that I have nothing of my own except my horrible faults, for which you suffered death to give me life. But there is more, Lord: according to what I understand and hope—and indeed it is truly so—if no one else but myself alone had sinned, you would still have redeemed my soul turned away from your love, by dying naked on the cross for me and exercising your power ordained to destroy sin. Thus, Lord, all that you have suffered in your sweet humanity, you have suffered for me, as if no one else had sinned but me alone, so that I owe this to you alone. And I owe you even more: indeed, in addition to what I do not have of my own, I owe you all the difference there is between you and me for whom you gave yourself. In any case, Lord, you know that I can do nothing, even though you have thus indebted me to you; but I pray you, dear and beloved, to acquit me of this debt by your courtesy, you who have the power to do all things. And, certainly, Lord, you will do it, provided that I henceforth will your perfect will in all things.

God without beginning
The Soul: Now, dearest Love, I beg you: show me how my operation is the very same as that of the Trinity.
Love: Tell me your thought, for you must not hide it from me.
The Soul: Lord Love, I will tell you. You have told me that the one who is in himself by himself without beginning will never love anything without me, nor I without him.
Love: That is true, I assure you.
The Soul: Since he will never love—meaning: without end—anything without me, it follows that he never loved anything without me. Indeed, since he will be without end in me by love, I have also been loved by him without beginning.
Reason: Be careful what you say, Madame! Have you forgotten that it was not long ago you were created, and that you were not? In the name of God, dearest soul, be careful not to fall into error!
The Soul: If I am mistaken in holding this opinion, Lady Reason, Love is mistaken with me, for he makes me believe, think, and say this.
Reason: Prove then what you say, Madame!
The Soul: How tiresome you are, Reason! What trouble and pain for those who live under your counsel! Reason, if I am loved without end by the three persons of the Trinity, I have also been loved by them without beginning: just as God will love me without end by his goodness, I was likewise in the knowledge of his Wisdom when it established that I would be created by the operation of his divine power. Thus, since I have been in divine knowledge since God is, who is without beginning, and I will be there without end, it follows that he has always loved by his goodness the operation he would perform in me by his divine power.
Love: That is true; from always, he would never have wanted to refrain from loving you, no more than he does now.
The Soul: There! Reason, you have heard Love's testimony; be silent henceforth, and cease meddling in my affairs!
Reason: Yes, Madame, since Love governs you and you do not govern Love; in other words, since Love dwells in you and makes of you his will without yourself, I will no longer dare to meddle with you or intervene. On the contrary, Madame, I promise you henceforth obedience and peace with all my power; indeed, I am forced to act thus, and since Love wills it, I cannot go against it, but rather I yield myself to you completely.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 36. Comment l’âme est libre et n’est plus soumise à Raison

The Soul, to Reason: Henceforth, the debts are indeed reversed, and rightly so, for the noble courtesy of my spouse would no longer deign to leave me in your servitude nor in that of another; for it is also necessary that the spouse liberate the wife he has freely taken.

Love: It is true, dearest soul, I grant you this and I confess it.

Reason: In the name of God, Madam, think, say, and do therefore all that you wish, since Love desires and grants it!

The Soul, to Reason: Reason, how harsh you are! Love desires and grants me to say, think, and do all that I wish: and why not? It is he who does it himself, for by myself, I can do nothing if my beloved does not do it himself in me. And you marvel that he desires what I desire? But, always, he must desire it, for I desire nothing other than what he desires in me and what he desires that I desire; by his courtesy, he has established me in such a way that he desires what I desire, and he desires nothing that I do not desire. And I am at peace, Reason, because we have, he and I, this concord.

[To God]: Yes, dearest master of this work, how can I have this peace, when I know I have thus lost my own operation? And yet, Lord, I can indeed! For your courtesy and your nobility desire that I too be at peace, since you are. So much so, Lord, that I see clearly that you have well discharged this debt—which was to give me peace—for whatever I find, whatever happens or has happened with my sins, your peace always remains with me.

greater glory
The soul [to God]: Lord, no one but you can know in this world the full extent of my sins in all their ugliness and hideousness; but in paradise, Lord, all who are there will know them, not to my shame, but to my very great glory, for in seeing that I have angered you with my sins, your mercy, Lord, will be known, as well as your generosity full of ‹courtoisie›.
Love [to God]: This ‹courtoisie› gives peace of conscience to this soul, no matter what she does or does not do, because she desires your will; for to perfectly desire your will is perfect charity, and whoever always has perfect charity in their will, will never have remorse or reproach of conscience. Indeed, remorse or reproach of conscience in the soul is nothing other than a lack of charity, for the soul is created for nothing other than to have within it endlessly the state of pure charity.
The soul [to God]: Yes, Lord, what have I said about you!
Love: Think about it, and see if you can recognize your words.
The soul: Yes, Lord Love, you have given me the understanding, you comprehend it now. The work is nothing when it must be nothing; therefore, I must be certain that what I have said is less than nothing. But what is in me or through me and is of divine understanding, it is you, Lord Love, who have spoken it in me and through me in your goodness, for my benefit and that of others; and thus, if it does not stop with the listeners or readers of this book, the glory will be yours and the benefit ours.

Recognizing fully her poverty
The soul [to God]: O beloved! whom I have abandoned and from whom I have turned away!
You are to me courteous beyond measure, as it must seem to me when you wish to suffer—suffer, Lord? and you wish it more willingly than anyone can say!—that I remain in my desert, that is to say, in this wretched body, without limit of time! Yet, for whatever mercy there is in you, I cannot recover the loss of past time, for it is necessary, dear and beloved, to keep your justice; and therefore, it cannot be that the lost time is ever returned to me, nor that I am not so far from loving you, knowing you, and praising you.
[To Love:] Ah! how many moments of idleness! How many faults into which I have fallen, I who am the abyss of all poverty! And yet, in this abyss of poverty, you wish to place, if it does not depend on myself, the gift of grace of which you have just spoken. Spoken? Truly, sire Love, all that you have said of this grace through the mouth of a creature, would only stammer in comparison to your work!
Reason: In the name of God, sire Love, I have listened well to what has been said, and I have never listened more willingly, although I have not understood it perfectly; but that could not be, Love, except for the one to whom this gift is made.
Love: This is true for her as for the Holy Spirit himself.
Reason: And that is why I said that I cannot understand it, but it seems to me that all that this soul has done, and which comes from you, is very well done.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 39. Comment Raison veut servir cette âme et en être esclave

Reason: Now, Lord Love, I beseech you, guide me, so that I may serve this soul in all things, as her pure slave, for I know that I can have no greater joy nor greater honor than to be the slave of this lady.
Love: I confess it to you, and you can do no better than to confess and say it.
Reason: Yes, dearest Love, but what shall I do with the people I have to govern, who will no longer see in this soul any disposition for their exercises and external affairs?
Love: Why do you say that? Is there any better disposition than that of this soul?
Reason: No, at least not for those who see a little clearly or for those who are chosen in this manner; but such people, there are few on earth, I dare say.
Love: Now, Reason, what do you call "disposition"?
Reason: I call "disposition" the life according to the works of the Virtues continually exercised under my counsel and that of Discernment, following the example of the works of Our Lord Jesus Christ.
Love: Reason, what the humanity of Jesus Christ suffered, the divinity did not feel. And I tell you the same, by comparison, of the one who is like him. Indeed, what you say of the Virtues or of yourself, Reason, this soul does not take into account. She can do better, for Love dwells in her, having transformed her into himself, so much so that this soul itself is Love, and Love has no discernment in him: one must have discernment in all things, but not in love. Here is a comparison: if a lord wants to collect the tribute of his land because it is rightfully due to him, it will not be the lord who owes the tribute to his serfs, but the serfs who owe it to their lord! Similarly, Reason, I tell you that all things owe me tribute when they are works of the Virtues advised by Reason and accomplished with Discernment; but not that one, and he alone, who is overwhelmed with love and transformed into Love: that one owes me nothing but love, and he is free, for Love acquits him.

Love: I call this soul supremely wise among my chosen; but one who is short of sense cannot appreciate or know a thing of great value.
Reason: Yes, Lord Love, but what do you call wise?
Love: It is to be immersed in humility.
Reason: Yes, Love, but who is immersed in humility?
Love: The one who, having no fault in anything, yet knows that he is right in nothing. The one who is in this knowledge of his fault sees so clearly that he sees himself below all creatures and in an ocean of sin. And because his enemies are slaves to sin and this soul has long seen that she is beneath them, a slave to sin as well (without any comparison between her and them, given what she is and her works!), she has reduced herself to nothing by this consideration, and to less than nothing in all she considers. She has long heard from the Holy Spirit that God would place the most abased in the highest position, by His sole and loyal goodness.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 41. Comment l’âme n’éprouve aucun chagrin pour les

sins she has ever committed, nor any hope for the good she has ever done.

Love: Nevertheless, this soul feels no sorrow for the sins she has ever committed, nor any hope for whatever she might do, but only for the goodness of God. And the secret treasure of this sole goodness has so annihilated her within herself that she is dead to all manner of feeling, both inwardly and outwardly, to the extent that she no longer performs any work, neither for God nor for herself; and thus she has all her senses so lost in this exercise that she cannot seek God nor find Him, nor guide herself. This soul is not with herself, so much so that she must be excused by all; and the one in whom she is, performs His work through her, and that is why she is well acquitted, by the testimony of God Himself who performs this work for her benefit, she who has no work within her.

Fear: Yes, Love, but where then is this soul, since she is not with herself?

Love: Where she loves, without feeling it. And it is because she does nothing that comes from within herself, that this soul lives without reproach of conscience. Indeed, he who does something of his own movement, he is not without himself, but rather has Nature and Reason with him; thus, he who is dead from love, neither feels nor knows Reason nor Nature. So much so that this soul would not desire any of the joys of paradise, even if they were offered to her to choose, nor would she refuse any of the torments of hell, even if it entirely depended on her will.

Holy Church[-the-Little]: But, in the name of God, what then?

Love: What she is in her knowledge.

Holy Church[the-Little]: And what then is this soul? Most dear Holy Spirit, teach us, for this word surpasses our writings, so much so that we cannot understand by reason what it says: but it has so astonished us that we dare not oppose it.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 42. Comment le Saint-Esprit enseigne ce que sait cette âme, qu’elle

The Holy Spirit [to Sainte-Eglise-la-Petite]: O Sainte-Eglise, do you wish to know what this soul knows and what it desires? I will tell you what it desires: this soul knows only one thing, which is that it knows nothing; likewise, it desires only one thing, and that is that it desires nothing. This knowing-nothing and desiring-nothing give it everything, and allow it to find the buried and hidden treasure, contained in the Trinity eternally. And this, not by divine nature, for that cannot be, but by the power of love, for it is fitting that it should be so.

Love [to Sainte-Eglise-la-Petite]: Now, Sainte-Eglise, you have heard why this soul possesses everything.

The Holy Spirit: Even more: everything that I hold from the Father and the Son. And since it has everything that I have, and the Father and the Son have nothing that I do not have within me, according to what Love says, this soul thus has, buried and contained within it, the treasure of the Trinity.

Sainte-Eglise[-la-Petite] to the Holy Spirit: Since this is so, it must be that the Trinity dwells and lives within it.

The Holy Spirit: That is correct; since it has died to the world and the world has died within it, the Trinity will always dwell within it.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 43. Comment ces âmes sont appelées « Sainte-Eglise », et ce que

Holy Church can speak of them
Holy Church[-the-Lesser]: O true God, Holy Spirit!
Love [to Holy Church-the-Lesser]: It is true,
Holy Church, you who are placed below that Holy Church! (Indeed, those souls are properly called Holy Church in that they support, teach, and nourish all of Holy Church; and not they, but the entire Trinity through them; and it is the truth, let no one doubt it.) O Holy Church, you who are placed below that Holy Church, tell us now what you wish to say of these souls, who are thus recommended and praised above you who exercise in all things the counsel of Reason?
Holy Church-the-Lesser: We wish to say that these souls live above us, for Love dwells in them and Reason dwells in us; but this is not against us, on the contrary: we recommend and praise them through the hidden meaning of our writings.
Reason: But, Lord Love, we would very much like to understand more openly, if it pleases you, this gift that the Holy Spirit gives to these souls in His pure goodness, but without anyone suffering any harm, due to their coarseness, in hearing this divine lesson.
Love: Yes, Reason, you will always be half-blind, you and all those who are nourished by your doctrine! For he is indeed half-blind who sees things before his eyes and does not know them, which is your case!
The Holy Spirit: If I have said that I will give to this soul all that I have, I will give it to her; but it is rather the entire Trinity that has promised her all that we have, and it is granted to her by its goodness in the science of its Wisdom without beginning; thus it is only just that we withhold nothing from such souls that we have. Indeed, this soul has given us everything that is hers; and that which we have, it is she herself who has given it to us, so to speak, for it is considered, and it is true, that good will takes the place of the work: this soul is of such a condition that, if she had in her that which we have, she would give it back to us just as we have it, without wanting any reward in heaven or on earth, solely for our will alone. We, we have the right to all this by our divine condition, but this soul gives it to us according to the mode of her will, which is contained in love without mode. And because this soul has given us all that she has, and all that is and that she does not have, according to the mode of her will, it is necessary, in the justice of love, that we give her what we have. And just as we have in us what we have by divine nature, this soul holds it from us in her by the justice of love.
Holy Church[-the-Lesser]: Yes, Lord, we understand and truly believe that your worthy nobility made this gift to her in reward of love, for Love can be rewarded in no other way sufficiently, except by Love.
Love: This soul has seen and known for a long time that there is no greater wisdom than temperance, no greater wealth than being satisfied, no greater strength than love. This soul has her memory, her understanding, and her will entirely immersed in a single state, immersed in God; and this state grants her to be without knowing, feeling, or willing any state, except only that which God has disposed. And for many days, she has languished in love.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 44. Quel est l'exercice de l'âme qui languit d’amour, et en quel

The state of the soul that has died of love
Reason: Well then, Lord Love, what is the occupation of a soul that languishes in love?
Love: It wages war against vices by acquiring virtues.
The Soul: Oh! Dearest Love, how great and perilous this war is! Surely, such an endeavor must indeed be called languor and a life of warfare!
Love: But now, it has languished so much in love that it has died of love.
Reason: In the name of God, Love, tell us in what state the soul that has died of love finds itself!
Love: It has done with the world, and the world with it, and it has taken leave of it; thus, it lives in God, and there it can find neither sin nor vice. It is so buried and immersed in God that neither the world, nor the flesh, nor its enemies can trouble it, for they cannot find it in their works; thus, this soul lives in rest and peace, for it accounts nothing created as its own. And because this soul is in such peace, it lives in the world without any remorse.
Reason: Also, this soul has no will; this state should be our state, for we have no higher merit before God than in relinquishing our will for His and in perfectly giving our will, desiring nothing except only to the measure of His operation and according to the dispositions of His goodness.
The Soul: This is what I hold to, and therefore I lack nothing. Indeed, no soul possesses perfect peace except the one that has no will.
Love: What do you know of it, Madam?
The Soul: But indeed, absolutely! This is what I do, Lord Love, for I have experienced it in harsh trials, and it was by a narrow margin that I did not die from it. And I would have died if the nothing-wanting had not drawn me out of it by the counsel of divine goodness. That one has no will who wills nothing; and he alone has given his will, and therefore he has nothing to will except the will of the one to whom he has given his will.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 45. Comment ceux qui n’ont point de volonté vivent en la liberté de

Charity
The Soul: People who have no will live in the freedom of charity, and if someone were to ask them what they want, they would truthfully say that they want nothing. These people have come to the knowledge of their nothingness; that is to say, whatever is within them, they cannot know their nothingness, for their knowledge has been too small to know this loss; they have come to trust in what surpasses them, and the knowledge that is born from this trust is in that one can know nothing of it.

Reason: Nothing?

Love: No; for if one knew as much as all that one will know in paradise, and even as much as all that one could compare it to through something that one could partially or otherwise understand of it, all that one would understand then would be nothing; and what one would understand by this comparison would still be nothing beside it, if one disregarded its power, its wisdom, its knowledge, and its goodness; and it would still be nothing if one added just a spark, no more, of its pure goodness. Whoever grasped more of it than one will ever grasp, as is said in this comparison, would still grasp nothing beside the smallest part that remains in it and is grasped only by itself. In other words, to better understand, the one who knew of it all that is said of it would still know nothing beside the great knowledge that remains in it beyond ours; yes, truly, what one could compare of the smallest part of its goodness by speaking of it would still be nothing compared to the greatness that is truly its own, even less than a spark beside it in its entirety.

The Soul: Lord God, what will the soul that believes this about you do?

God: It will do nothing, but I will do my work in it without it. Indeed, the knowledge of its nothingness and the trust in me have reduced it to nothing so much that it can do nothing; so much so that the knowledge of this nothingness, compared to the greatness of this all, has entirely excused and liberated it, for it lacks nothing, since it wants nothing.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 46. Comment l’âme a connaissance de ce qui la dépasse en ce que,

In her opinion, she knows nothing of God compared to what, in Him, surpasses her.
Love: Now, this soul has reached and come to know what surpasses her; yes truly, simply because she knows nothing of God in relation to what He is entirely.
Reason: Oh! Will one dare to call "nothing" something that belongs to God?
The soul: Indeed! And how so! Truly, it is indeed nothing, all that can or could be given to us from Him. Yes, truly, even supposing that He gives us what is mentioned earlier in this writing; for in comparison, if it could be that it were true, it would still be nothing next to a single spark of His goodness, but it remains in His knowledge and outside of ours.
Oh, oh! And what to say of Him entirely, since one can say so much good of what is lesser than Him? Yes, dearest and beloved, that, you alone know, and it suffices me that it is so.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 47. Comment l’âme en est venue à la connaissance de son néant

Love: You have thus heard how this soul came to trust in what surpasses her. Now, I will tell you how she came to the knowledge of her nothingness: it is by knowing that neither she nor anyone else knows anything of her horrible sins and faults, compared to what they are in the knowledge of God. This soul retained no will, but rather came and arrived at wanting nothing, and in a certain knowledge of knowing nothing; and this knowing-nothing and wanting-nothing excused and liberated her. This soul adheres to the counsel of the Gospel saying: "Let your eye be single, and thus you shall not sin."

Thus, this soul is peaceful in all that God endures from her, for she understands all things according to the truth and remains in peaceful rest no matter what her neighbor does. Indeed, in all that she does not understand, she passes no judgment, except always for the good.

This soul finds peace everywhere, for she carries it continually with her, so much so that in this peace all places suit her, and all things as well. And she sits without moving on the throne of Peace which is in the book of life, with the testimony of a good conscience and in the freedom of perfect charity.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 48. Comment l’âme n’est pas libre lorsqu’elle désire que la volonté

of God be done in her to His honor
Love: Henceforth, the soul desires nothing more, for she is free; indeed, he is not free, whatever he may wish, who desires something from his inner will for himself, for he is a slave to himself insofar as he wishes that God fulfills his will for his own honor; he who desires this does not wish it solely to fulfill the will of God in himself and in others. To such people, God has denied His kingdom.
Reason: But certainly, this is how they would act.
The Soul: Yes, truly, this is how they would act, for they must, under penalty of losing the little profit that is theirs.
Reason: It is true, Madam, I confess it to you.
Love: These people are ill at peace, whatever they may think; and because they think so, their state suffices for them.
The Soul: They are not rich enough to think that there is someone greater than themselves, and this prevents them from becoming better, and thus they remain with their good intentions.
Love: These people have never been satisfied!
The Liberated Soul: No, certainly; since their will remains, they are slaves to it. In this servitude, the soul that trusts entirely in these two Virtues, which are Reason and Fear, and in this tyrannical will; whereas only he is free, who is governed by Faith and Love, for they draw him out of all servitude, without fearing dreadful things or desiring any of the most delightful things.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 49. Comment est noble cette âme qui n’a point de volonté

Love: This soul has no will, and thus, it does not care whether God does this or that, but that He always does His will. Indeed, this soul is liberated and content: it needs neither hell, nor paradise, nor any created thing; it neither wants nor does not want anything that is named here.

Holy-Little-Church: But, in the name of God, how is that possible?

Love: Nothing, it wants nothing. But saying this seems very strange to those who expect great returns from the yield of love! It is no wonder, but while no one could think or believe without being mistaken that this is a great harm to them, it seems strange to them.

The Soul: Those people are so blinded that a great thing seems small to them.

Love: It is true, dear soul, what you say; for as much as God's work is better than a creature's work, so much better is this nothing-wanting in God than the good-wanting for God. More: supposing that, by this good-wanting, these people could perform miracles and receive martyrdom every day for the love of God, there would still be no comparison between the two, since their will remains. And there would still be none if, thanks to this will, they were every day taken up to heaven to see the Trinity, as it was for the apostle Saint Paul.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 50. Comment cette âme porte la marque de Dieu, telle la cire celle

of a seal
Love: This soul bears the mark of God, and its true imprint is maintained by the union of love; and just as wax takes the form of the seal, this soul takes the mark of this model.
The soul: Indeed, however much God loves us, as He has shown through His divine works and His human sufferings, He does not love us against His will; and if He died for us, and took on human flesh for us, it was of His own free will, as a testament to His goodness; and He owed it to me, since His divine will desired it. No, He did not love us against His will! Indeed, if everything that the Trinity had created in its knowledge were to be damned without end, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, would not have deviated from the truth to save us all.
Woe is me! From where comes what I have said? Does not everyone know that this cannot be?
Love: Yes, dearest and most beloved, my beloved ones know that this cannot be.
God the Father: But you, who are my dearest beloved, you say this because such must be my eldest daughter, the heir to my kingdom, the one who knows the secrets of the Son through the love of the Holy Spirit who has given them to this soul.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 51. Comment cette âme est semblable à la divinité

Love: This soul must indeed be akin to divinity, for it is transformed into God, whereby its true form is maintained, which is granted and given to it without beginning by the one who has always loved it in His goodness.
The Soul: Yes, Love, the wisdom of what is said has reduced me to nothing, and this very nothingness has plunged me into an abyss more unfathomable than what is less than nothing. And the knowledge of my nothingness has given me everything, and the nothingness of this everything has taken away prayer and supplication, and I no longer pray for anything.
Holy-Church-the-Little: And what do you do then, most dear lady and mistress?
The Soul: I rest in complete peace, alone, reduced to nothing, entirely at the courtesy of God's sole goodness, without a single desire moving me, whatever its richness. The fulfillment of my work is to always want nothing. For as long as I want nothing, I am alone in Him, without myself, and entirely free; whereas in wanting something, I am with myself, and thus lose my freedom. And if I want nothing, if I have lost everything outside of my will, I lack nothing: my conduct is free, and I want nothing from anyone.
Love: O most precious Esther, you who have lost all exercise, and whose exercise, through this loss, is to do nothing, yes, you are truly most precious! For, in truth, this exercise and this loss occur in the nothingness of your beloved, and in this nothingness, you swoon and remain dead, while you live, beloved, entirely in His will: that is His chamber, and it is there that He delights to dwell.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 52. Comment Amour fait l’éloge de cette âme, et comment elle

dwells in the abundance and riches of divine love
Love, to this precious pearl: Welcome, noble lady, to the only free manor where no one enters unless they are of your lineage and without bastardy.
[To the listeners:] This soul has entered into the abundance and riches of divine love; not that she has reached it through divine knowledge, for it is impossible for any understanding, however enlightened, to grasp the riches of divine love. Rather, the love of this soul is so united with the riches of the excellence of this excess of divine love — it is not the understanding of love, but its excess that reaches it — that she finds herself adorned with the ornaments of this excess of peace in which she lives, endures, is, was, and will be without her own being. Indeed, just as iron takes on fire and loses its appearance because the fire that transforms it is stronger than it, this soul takes on what surpasses her here; she is nourished and transformed in it due to her love for it, without regard for what does not surpass her. Rather, she dwells and is transformed in what surpasses her from this excess of eternal peace, without being found anywhere: she loves in the sweet land of the excess of peace, so that nothing can help or trouble those who love her, neither creature, nor given thing, nor anything that God promises.
Reason: What is this then?
Love: It is what has never been given, nor is, nor will be, that has stripped her bare and reduced her to nothing, without her caring for anything that exists, nor wanting to be helped or spared by its power, wisdom, or goodness.
The soul, speaking of her beloved: He is, that does not fail him; and I am not, so that it does not fail me either and he has given me peace; and I live only from the peace that is born of his gifts in my soul, without thought; and thus I can do nothing if it is not given to me: this is my all and my best possession. And this state makes one possess a single love, a single will, and a single operation in two natures: such is the power of the annihilation of the unity of divine justice.
[Love, to the listeners:] This soul lets the dead bury the dead and the lost act according to the Virtues, and she rests from what does not surpass her in what surpasses her, while using all things. What surpasses her shows her naked nothingness, and this nakedness shows her the Almighty through the goodness of divine justice. These considerations make her deep, wide, high, and assured, for they continually hold her naked, both all and nothing.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 53. Comment Raison demande explication de ce qui est dit plus

Reason: Dearest Soul, immersed in the bottomless depths of complete humility! Most precious stone, you whom Truth carries on its plain! You, the unique sovereign, though not over those in your domain, I beseech you: tell us what these veiled words that Fine Love uses mean!

The Soul: Reason, even if someone told you and you heard it, you would still not understand. Your questions have dishonored and spoiled this book, for there are people who would have understood it in a few words, but they have lengthened it because of the answers you and those you have nurtured, who advance at a snail's pace, need. Indeed, you have opened it to those of your house, and they move at a snail's pace!

Love: Opened? Yes, truly, in that Reason and all those in its school cannot protest that it does not seem well said to them, whatever understanding they may have of it.

The Soul: It is true, for only he understands it who masters Fine Love; thus, he must be dead to all mortal death, he who understands it with finesse, for no one tastes this life unless he is dead to all death.

Reason: Well then! Treasurer of Love, tell us how many kinds of deaths
you had to die before you understood this book with subtlety.
The Soul: Ask Love, for he knows the truth of it.
Reason: Well then! Lord Love, thank God! Tell us, not only for me and for those I have nurtured, but also for those who have taken leave of me and to whom this book will bring, if it pleases God, the light.
Love: Reason, those who have taken leave of you will still partake of your nourishment concerning the two deaths by which this soul has died and truly died; but the third death by which it has died, no living person understands, except the one who stands on the mountain.
Reason: In the name of God, tell us then who are the people of the mountain!
Love: They are those who have on earth neither shame, nor honor, nor fear of anything that may happen to them.
Reason: My God! Lord Love, in the name of God, answer our questions before going any further! For I fear and dread hearing the life of this soul.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 55. Comment Amour répond aux questions de Raison

Love: Reason, those who live as this book describes (those who have reached the state proper to this life) understand it quickly without ever needing the hidden meaning explained. But I will explain something about your questions; now, understand:

There are two kinds of people who lead a life of perfection according to the works of virtue in spiritual affection.

Some are those who completely mortify their bodies by performing works of charity; but they take so much pleasure in their works that they are unaware that there is a better state than that of the works of virtue and the death of the martyr, than the desire to persevere in it with a prayer full of supplications and the abundance of good will; and, always because of the constancy they put into it, they think that this is the best of all states that can be. These people are happy, but they perish in their works due to the sufficiency they place in their state. They are called kings, but it is in the land where everyone is one-eyed; and surely, those who have two eyes consider them slaves.

The Soul: Yes, slaves, they truly are, but they do not know it. They resemble the owl that thinks there is no more beautiful bird in the woods than her owlets! Like her, those who live in perpetual desire think and believe that there is no better state than that of desiring, a state in which they remain and wish to remain; and they perish on the way because they place their satisfaction in what desire and will give them.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 56. Comment les Vertus se plaignent d’Amour qui leur porte si peu

The Virtues: Alas, my God! Lord Love, who then will honor us, since you say that those who live entirely under our counsel perish? Truly, if someone else told us this, we would consider them a fool and a bad Christian! For we cannot understand how anyone could perish by fully following our teachings, in the fervor of the desire that provides the true way to feel Jesus Christ; and yet, we believe perfectly and without a shadow of a doubt, Lord Love, everything you say.

Love: It is true; but to understand this, that is the mark of a master, for therein lies the grain of the divine nourishment.

The Virtues: We believe it, Love, but it is not through our office that we understand it. However, we are well absolved if we believe you, regardless of our understanding, for we are made by you to serve such souls.

The Soul, to the Virtues: Indeed, that is well said, one must surely believe you! And that is why I declare this to all who will hear this book: those who serve a poor lord for a long time, expect poor wages and little pay! Now, it is thus that the Virtues have well recognized and perceived — let those who have ears hear! — that they do not understand the state of ‹Fin Amour›. Therefore, I say this: how will the Virtues teach their subjects what they neither have nor will ever have? So, whoever wants to understand and learn how those who remain in the Virtues perish, let them ask Love, I mean that Love which is the master of Knowledge, and not the love that is its son, for he knows nothing of it; better still: let them ask the Love that is the father of Knowledge and divine Light, for he knows everything about it, because of what, in this all, surpasses this soul; and she stops there and remains there, so much so that she can only dwell in this all.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 57. De ceux qui sont en l’état des égarés, et comment ils sont

Love: You now know which people have perished, in what manner, from what cause, and why. Now, we shall also tell you who are the lost ones, those who are slaves and merchants; however, they act more wisely than those who have perished.

The Soul: Well then! Lord Love, you who make all things light, tell us, by Love, why they remain in virtues as much as those who have perished, and why they serve them, those who feel and desire in the ardor of the cutting edge of the operation of the spirit. Those who have perished do this as much as the lost ones; where then is the better thing that makes you praise them more than those who have perished?

Love: Where is it? In many places, for that is all the good there is to come to the state from which those who have perished can no longer receive any help.

The Liberated Soul: Well then! Love of divine Love, I beg you to tell us why these lost ones are wise, compared to those who have perished, when their exercise is the same, except in this wisdom for which you appreciate them more than the others.

Love: It is because they hold that there is a state better than their own; thus they know well that they have no knowledge of this better state in which they believe. And the fact of believing in it gives them so little knowledge and satisfaction in their state, that they consider themselves bad and lost. And indeed, they are such, compared to the freedom of those who are in this better state and who never move. And because they hold and know in truth that they are lost, they often ask their way with ardent desire, from the one who knows it, that is to say, from Lady Knowledge, illuminated by divine grace. And their questions move this lady to pity — those who have been lost know this well — and that is why she teaches them the right royal path through the land of ‹rien-vouloir›. This direction is the right one: whoever takes it knows if I speak the truth, and they know it too, these lost people who consider themselves bad; indeed, if they are lost, they can come to the state of the free people we speak of, thanks to the teaching of this divine light, to whom this humble and lost soul asks for her way and direction.

Reason: Of humble condition? Yes indeed, and more than humble!

The Holy Spirit adds: It is true as long and as much as she will ask questions of Knowledge and Love, and will take into account things that can neither be in love, nor in knowledge, nor in praise; for no wise person prays without reason nor cares about what cannot be. And that is why it can well be said that one is of humble and poor condition, who asks much, or even who does not ask much. Indeed, any other state, whatever it may be, than the sovereign state of ‹rien-vouloir› in which those who are free stand without moving, is but a game of ball and a child's play, compared to it; indeed, one who is free in the state that belongs to him, could neither refuse, nor want, nor promise anything because of what could be given to him, but he would want to give everything because of the loyalty he wishes to keep.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 58. Comment les âmes anéanties sont au cinquième état1 avec leur

Beloved
Reason: In the name of God, what can souls annihilated to such a degree possibly give?
Love: What can they give? Why, everything that God disposes of! The soul in this state is neither lost nor astray; rather, it is in the raptures of the fifth state with its lover. There, it does not falter, so much so that it is often enraptured to the sixth state; but this lasts only briefly, for it is an opening that occurs like a flash: it closes immediately, and one cannot remain there long; and never has there been a master who could speak of it.

By the peace of its operation, the rapture that overflows from this opening after it has closed renders the soul so free, so noble, and so unburdened by all things—as long as the peace given in this opening lasts—that one who maintains this freedom after such an experience would find themselves in the fifth state without falling back into the fourth; for in the fourth, one has will, whereas in the fifth, one has none. And because there is no will in the fifth state of which this book speaks—a state where the soul remains after the operation of ‹Loin-Près› that enraptures it, which we call a flash-like opening that immediately closes—no one could believe the extremity of peace this soul receives, save the soul itself.

[To the listeners:] For the love of God, understand this divinely, listeners of this book. This ‹Loin-Près›, which we call a flash-like opening that immediately closes, takes the soul in the fifth state and carries it to the sixth as long as its operation lasts, creating a new state; but this sixth state lasts only briefly, for the soul is returned to the fifth. And this is no wonder, for the operation of this flash, as long as it lasts, is nothing other than the appearance of the soul's glory. This does not remain long in a creature, but only for the time it takes to manifest. And this gift is noble in that it produces its work in the soul before it appears to it and before it becomes aware of it. But the peace produced by my operation, which remains in the soul as long as I produce it there, is so delightful that Truth calls it "glorious nourishment"; and no one can be nourished by it if they remain in desire. Those who experience this could govern a country if needed, but everything would be done without them.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 59. De quoi vécut cette âme ; comment et quand elle est sans elle-

Love: In the beginning, this soul lived in a state of grace, grace born from the death to sin. Then, it lived in a spiritual life, a life born from the death to nature; and now, it lives in a divine life, a life born from the death to the spirit. This soul, living in a divine life, is perpetually without itself.
Reason: In the name of God, when then is this soul without itself?
Love: When it is with itself.
Reason: And when is it with itself?
Love: When it is nowhere by its own will, neither in God, nor in itself, nor in its neighbor, but in the annihilation that this flash brings about in it at the approach of its operation. This operation is so preciously noble that, just as one cannot speak of the opening of a single movement of glory given by the lovable flash, there is no soul that can speak of the precious closing that makes it forget itself by annihilating the knowledge that this annihilation gives of itself.
The soul: My God! What a great lord, he who could understand the profit of a single movement of such annihilation!
Love: Yes, indeed.
The soul, to the listeners of this book: In what has just been said, you have heard words of high elevation! So, if it pleases you, I will now speak of humble things; I must do so if I am to accomplish the undertaking I have projected, not for those who are already there, but for those who are not yet there and who will be one day, even if they must be deprived of it as long as they remain with themselves.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 60. Comment il faut mourir de trois morts avant de venir à la vie

free and annihilated
Love: You asked us, Reason, how many deaths one must die before coming to this life. I answer you thus: before the soul can be born into this life, it must die entirely three deaths. The first is the death to sin, as you have heard; the soul must die to it completely, in such a way that there remains in it neither color, nor taste, nor smell of anything that God forbids in the Law. Those who die thus live in a life of grace, and it suffices for them to refrain from doing what God forbids and to be able to do what God commands.
[To the annihilated souls:] Yes, most noble people, you who are annihilated and elevated in great astonishment and admiration by the conjunction effected by the union of Divine Love, do not be displeased if I touch upon certain matters for people of humble condition, for I will soon speak of your state. In the meantime, putting white and black together makes these two colors better seen by each other than by themselves.
[To the disciples of Reason:] Now, you who are chosen and called to this sovereign state, understand and hasten, for the road is very great and the path is long between the first state of grace and the final state of glory given by the amiable Far-Near. If I ask you to understand and hasten, it is because understanding this is both difficult, subtle, and very noble; the sanguine are aided by nature in this, but without the haste of the cutting will of the ardor of the spirit's desire that it gives to the choleric. So much so that when these two natures are united, namely the nature and the ardor of the spirit's desire, it is a great advantage, for people of this kind adhere and attach themselves so strongly to what they undertake, that they are wholly where they apply themselves, by the force of desire and nature; and when these two natures agree with the third which, by justice, must join them forever (that is to say, the abyss of glory which, by justice, naturally attracts them in its nature), this agreement is of refined nobility. And to better understand this, I pose the following question: what is the most noble thing, the abyss that attracts the soul and adorns it with the beauty of its nature, or the soul that is united to this glory?
The soul [to the listeners:] I do not know if this bores you, but I can do no better. Excuse me, but Jealousy of Love and Work of Charity, with which I was burdened, have made this book so that you may come to this without delay, at least in will, if you still have it. And if you are already unburdened of all things, if you are people without will and leading a life that is above your understanding, it has been made so that at least you may speak of its hidden meaning.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 61. Où Amour parle des sept états de l’âme1

Love: I have said that there are seven states of the soul, each more difficult to comprehend than the last and incomparable to one another; for what one might say of a drop of water beside the whole sea in its immensity, one could say of the first state of grace beside the second, and so on for the others, without comparison between them. However, among the first four, there is none so great that the soul does not live in very great bondage; but the fifth is in the freedom of charity, for it is unburdened of all things; and the sixth is glorious, for the opening of the sweet movement of glory that the lovable ‹Loin-Près› gives is nothing other than an apparition that God wishes the soul to have of its own glory which it will possess endlessly. And that is why He shows it by His goodness in the sixth state what belongs to the seventh; this manifestation comes from the seventh state and procures the sixth, but it is given so swiftly that the very one to whom it is given does not perceive the gift that is made to her.

The Soul: What is marvelous about that? If I perceived it before this gift was made to me, I would be in myself, by divine goodness, what the given is and what it will give me endlessly when my body has left my soul.

The Spouse of this Soul: It does not depend on her: by my ‹Loin-Près›, I have sent you an advance. But some ask who this ‹Loin-Près› is, and what its works and operations are when it shows its glory to the soul; indeed, one can say nothing of it, except that the ‹Loin-Près› is the Trinity itself, and this manifestation it performs for the soul, we call it "movement," not that the soul or the Trinity moves, but because the Trinity performs for this soul the manifestation of its glory. Of this, no one can speak, except the divinity itself; for the soul to whom this ‹Loin-Près› is given has such great knowledge of God, of itself, and of all things, that it sees in God himself, by divine knowledge, that the light of this knowledge takes away from it the knowledge of itself, of God, and of all things.

The Soul: It is true, there is nothing else to say. And yet, if God wants me to have this great knowledge, let Him take it away from me and prevent me from knowing it, for otherwise, I would have no knowledge of it. And if He wants me to know myself, let Him also take away the knowledge of myself, for otherwise, I cannot have it either.

Love: Madam, what you say is true: but there is nothing more certain to know nor more profitable to possess than this work.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 62. De ceux qui sont morts au péché mortel et nés à la vie de grâce1

Love: Now, Reason, understand: I return to our subject concerning people of humble condition. These people we have spoken of, who have died to mortal sin and been born to the life of grace, they feel no reproach or remorse of conscience as long as they fulfill what God commands. They desire honors and are dismayed if they are despised, but they guard themselves against vainglory and impatience, which lead to the death of sin. They love riches and are sad when they are poor—and if they are rich, losing something makes them sad—but they always guard against the death of sin, and do not wish to love their riches against God's will, neither in loss nor in gain. And they love to be at ease and to rest at their pleasure, but they guard against disorder. These people have died to mortal sin and been born to the life of grace.

The Soul: My faith! These people, their condition is indeed humble on earth and even more humble in heaven! And it is in a very uncourteous manner that they save themselves!

Reason: Hold on! Madam, be careful what you say! We would not dare say of anyone that they are of humble condition when they shall see God endlessly!

Love: Truly, one could not describe their pettiness, compared to the nobility of those who die the death to nature and live the life according to the spirit.

Reason: I believe it well; that is what they do, and if they said otherwise, they would be lying; and yet, they do not wish to do anything for this nobility. They tell me, Reason, that they are not bound to it if they do not wish to, for God has not commanded it of them: He has indeed advised it, but no more.

The Soul: They speak the truth, but they are uncourteous!

Desire: My faith, yes! They are indeed uncourteous! They have forgotten that it would not have sufficed for Jesus Christ to do less for them than all that humanity can endure unto death.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 63. Comment Amour traite de vilains ceux à qui il suffit d’être

The soul: Yes, dearest Jesus Christ, do not concern yourself with those people! They seek their own interest so much that they forget you, in the coarseness where they find their satisfaction.

Love: Indeed, that is great vileness!

The soul: These are the ways of merchants, those whom the world calls "‹vilains›," for they are indeed. In fact, a gentleman could never involve himself in trade or seek his own interest. But I will tell you how I find rest from these people: sire Love, it is in that they are excluded from the court of your secrets, just as a ‹vilain› would be from the court of a gentleman during a judgment among peers, for there, no one can be present who is not of high lineage, at least when it concerns the court of a king. And in this, I find peace, for they too are excluded from the court of your secrets, while others are called there, those who will never forget the works of your sweet courtesy, that is, the scorn, the poverty, and the unbearable torments that you endured for us: they will never forget the gifts of your suffering; rather, it is always a mirror and a model for them.

Love: To these people, every necessary thing is granted, for Jesus Christ promised it in the Gospel. They are saved infinitely more courteously than the others; and yet, they are still people of humble condition, so humble, indeed, that it cannot be expressed, compared to the nobility of those who have died to life according to the spirit.

Love: No one tastes of this life unless they have died this death.
Truth: This death carries away the flower of the love of divinity. There is no intermediary between these souls and the divinity; and they desire none either. They cannot bear the memory of any human love nor the desire for divine ways of feeling, because of the pure divine love they bear for Love. This sole possession of Love grants them the flower of the effervescence of love, as testified by Love itself.
Love1: It is true. The love of which we speak is the union of lovers, it is a blazing fire that burns without tiring.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 65. Où l'on parle de ceux qui siègent sur la haute montagne, au-

Love: There you have it, Reason; you have heard something of the three deaths from which one comes to these three lives. Now, I will tell you who sits on the mountain, above the winds and the rains: they are those who have on earth neither shame, nor honor, nor fear of anything that may happen. These people are in safety, so much so that their doors remain open without anyone being able to trouble them and without the work of charity daring to enter: they are the ones who sit on the mountain, and no one else.

Reason: In the name of God, Lord Love, tell us what will become of Modesty, the most beautiful of Humility's daughters; and Fear, too, who has done so much good for this soul and rendered her so many fine services; and what will become of me, who have not slept as long as they have needed me! Alas! Will we be cast out of her dwelling because she has become its mistress?

Love: Not at all; on the contrary, all three of you will remain in her house, and you will be three guardians at her door, so that if anyone wishes to enter her abode and is against Love, each of you will awaken; but do not show yourselves for any other office than that of doorkeeper, for it would lead to your confusion; besides, you would only be heeded in this role and no other, and even then, only if this soul falls so low that there is need or necessity for it. Indeed, this creature is rather clothed in the divine life we have spoken of, than in the spirit placed in her own body at her creation. Thus, her body is rather clothed in her spirit, than her spirit in her body, for the coarseness of the body is removed and diminished by divine operation; so much so that this soul is rather in the sweet land of the unknown, where she loves, than in her own body to which she gives life: such is the power of the freedom of Love.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 66. Comment l’âme se réjouit d’avoir pris congé de Raison et des

other Virtues
Holy-Little-Church: Well then! dear and divine Love...
The soul: Yes, truly it is little! for it will not wait long to come to its end, which will bring it great joy.
Reason: Nevertheless, tell me, what has brought you the most joy within yourself?
The soul: Lord Love will speak for me.
Love: It is having taken leave of you and the works of the Virtues! For when this soul was invested with love, it took lessons at your school, desiring the works of the Virtues. But now it is so advanced and elevated in the divine lesson that it begins to read where you end; and this lesson is not written by the hand of man, but by the Holy Spirit who writes it wonderfully, and the soul is the precious parchment: it is within her that the divine school resides, with closed mouth, and human wisdom cannot put it into words.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 67. Où l’on parle du pays où cette âme demeure, et de la Trinité

Reason: Well then, Love, I would ask you to tell me more about the place where this soul dwells.
Love: I tell you that the one who is there where this soul is, is of himself, in himself, and by himself, without receiving anything from anyone, except from himself alone. Now, this soul is in him, of him, and for him, without receiving anything from anyone, except from him alone.
Truth: She is therefore in God the Father, for we believe that there is no person in the Trinity who has received anything from another except from the Father alone.
Love: That is true, for God the Father possesses divine power of himself, without receiving it from anyone; indeed, what he possesses emanates from his divine power, and he gives to his Son that very thing which he possesses of himself, and the Son receives it from the Father, so that the Son is born of the Father and is equal to him. As for the Holy Spirit, he is of the Father and the Son, a person in the Trinity; not born, but is, for it is one thing that the Son is born of the Father, another thing that the Holy Spirit is of both the Father and the Son.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 68. Comment cette âme est unie à la Trinité par opération divine, et

how she treats as donkeys those who live by the counsel of Reason
Love: This soul is entirely melted, liquefied, and absorbed in the high Trinity, joined and united to it; and it can desire nothing other than the divine will, through the divine operation of the whole Trinity. A clarity, a ravishing light, unites with it and presses it closely, and thus it speaks:
The Soul: O wretched, rude, and inappropriate people!
Reason: To whom are you speaking?
The Soul: To all those who live by your counsel, who are so foolish and asinine that I must disguise my language because of their coarseness, and not speak it, for fear that they might find death in the state of life, where I am in peace without moving; to all those, because of their coarseness, I say that I must conceal and disguise my language, the one I learned in secret at the secret court of the sweet land; in this land, courtesy is law, love is measure, and goodness, nourishment; sweetness attracts me there, beauty pleases me there, goodness feeds me there; what more can I do, since I live in peace?

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 69. Où l’âme dit que l’exercice des Vertus n’est qu’inquiétude et

Reason: In the name of God, most sweet and spotless flower, what do you think of our labor?

The Soul: It seems to me that it is a labor full of worries! Nevertheless, it is in these worries that one earns their bread and sustenance through their toil; and Jesus Christ ennobles it with His own body, He who saw the animality of those who would be saved through this labor and who needed to be assured of it: Jesus Christ, who did not want to lose them, guaranteed it to them Himself through His death, through His Gospels and His Scriptures, where laboring people seek the right path.

Reason: And you, where do you seek the right path, our dearest lady, you who undertake and accept your labor not in this anxiety, but through the faith from which you receive these gifts?

The Soul: No indeed, I am free from that! What I have that is best is elsewhere and so far removed from it that it cannot be compared: its end is in God who is not in time, whereas I am here to reach it through Him; for what I have that is best is that I am established in my nothingness.
Now, Reason, you ask us where we find the right path; I tell you it is with Him alone who is so strong that He can never die, and whose doctrine is not written, whether by exemplary works or by the doctrine of men, for the gift He gives cannot be given in a limited form. He has always known that I trust Him without witness: is there a greater vileness than wanting witnesses in love? No, certainly, it seems to me; since Love is witness enough for me: if I wanted more, I would not trust Him.

Reason: Yes, Madam, but you have two laws, namely yours and ours: ours to believe, and yours to love. Nevertheless, please tell us why you called those whom we nourish "beasts" and "asses"!

The Soul: These people whom I call asses, they seek God in creatures, in monasteries through prayers, in created paradises, human words, and Scriptures. Surely, Benjamin is not born among these people, for Rachel lives in them; whereas Rachel must die at Benjamin's birth, and until Rachel is dead, Benjamin cannot be born. It seems to novices that the people who seek God thus through mountains and valleys, claim that He is subject to His sacraments and His works. Alas! What pity for all their woes, and for all those they will have as long as they remain in this way and this exercise! While they pass the time well and enjoy themselves, those who worship God not only in temples and monasteries but in all places and by union with the divine will!

Reason: Yes, but you who are so well-born, tell us, in the name of God: where do you seek Him, and where do you find Him?

The Soul: I find Him everywhere, and that is where He is. He is a single divinity, one God in three persons, and this God is wholly everywhere: that is where I find Him.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 70. Comment cette âme est ce qu’elle est par la grâce de Dieu1

Reason: Now, dear lady, tell us a little about who you are, to speak to us in this manner.
The soul: I am what I am by the grace of God. Therefore, I am only what God is in me and nothing else; and God also is exactly what He is in me. Indeed, nothing is nothing, and what is, is; and thus, I am not, if I am, but what God is, and no one is, except God; and that is why I find only God, wherever I penetrate, for nothing is, except Him, to speak truly.
This soul loves in truth, that is to say, in divinity, but Truth loves in the one from whom this soul derives its being; thus the entire work of Charity is accomplished in her.
Love: It is true, for all souls, except this one, hide themselves due to a lack of innocence, because of the sin of Adam.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 80. Comment l’âme chante et déchante

The Soul: At one moment I sing, at another I lament, but all this is for those who are not yet free, so that they may hear some points concerning freedom and what is required to attain it.

Love: By a divine light, this soul has glimpsed the state of the land where it must be, and it has crossed the sea to suck the marrow of the high cedar. Indeed, no one takes or reaches this marrow without crossing the high sea and drowning their will in its waves. You who love, understand what this means.

I have just said that, through me, this soul has come to nothingness, and even to less than infinitely nothing: indeed, just as God is ungraspable in His power, this soul is indebted for its ungraspable nothingness for a single hour of time when it set its will against Him. It owes Him, without reduction, the debt that its will deserves, and this as many times as it has sought to withhold it from Him.

The Soul: O true God, You who see and endure this, who then will pay this debt? (Answering herself:) Well! dear Lord, You will pay it Yourself! For the full goodness that emanates from Your courtesy could not bear that I should not be acquitted by the gift of Love, from Him to whom You make pay in an instant all my debts. This most sweet ‹Loin-Près› has borne the last penny of my debt, and He tells me that You owe me as much as I owe You. Indeed, if I owe You as much as You are worth, You owe me as much as You have, for such is the generosity of Your divine nature. And, moreover, this amiable ‹Loin-Près› of whom I have just spoken says that these two debts must cancel each other out and henceforth become one; and I agree, for this is the counsel of my neighbor.

Reason: But, in the name of God, Madam, who then is your closest neighbor?

The Soul: It is the exaltation that ravishes me: it invades me and unites me to the heart of the marrow of divine Love, and I am liquefied by it; it is therefore just that I remember it, for I am abandoned in it. One must be silent about this state, for nothing can be said of it.

Love: Nothing, indeed. No more than one could long confine the sun, can this soul truly say anything of this life, compared to what it really is.

Astonishment: Yes, Madam, you are a source of divine love, a source where the fountain of divine knowledge is born, a source and fountain where the river of divine praise is born.

The Soul, confirmed in her nothingness: I abandon everything perfectly, to the divine will.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 91. Comment la volonté de ces âmes est la volonté d'Amour ; quelle

The Soul: Those people do nothing that does not please them, and if they did, they would deprive themselves of peace, freedom, and nobility. Indeed, a soul is not complete until it does what pleases it and feels no remorse in fulfilling its own desires.

Love: That is true, for its will is ours: it has crossed the Red Sea and its enemies have remained there. Its desire is our will, due to the purity of the unity of the will of the divinity, where we have enclosed it. Its will is ours, for it has fallen from grace into the perfection of the work of the Virtues, from the Virtues into Love, from Love into Nothingness, and from Nothingness into the glorification of God, which is seen through the eyes of His majesty who has glorified it here by Himself. Thus, it is so surrendered to Him that it no longer sees either itself or Him; and that is why He sees Himself alone, due to His divine goodness. He will be in this goodness by Himself, which He had of Himself before the soul existed and to which He gives His goodness, making it sovereign: such was His free will, and He cannot find it again by Himself without the soul's consent; but He now finds it without any "why," at the very point where He had it before the soul became sovereign over it. No one sees this but Him, no one loves but Him, for no one exists but Him; and therefore, He alone loves, He alone sees Himself, and He alone praises Himself for what He is in Himself. And here, I stop, for this is the noblest state the soul can know here below.

But there are five states below this one, and one must go through all that each of them demands before the soul can receive this sixth state, which is the most profitable, the noblest, and the most lovable of all. As for the seventh, it is in paradise, and it is perfect without lacking anything. Thus does God perform His divine works in His creatures through His goodness: where He is, the Holy Spirit breathes, and that is how He performs His wonders in them.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 92. Comment l’âme se désencombre de Dieu, d’elle-même et de son

The satisfied soul: Yes, Lord, you have suffered so much for us, and you have accomplished so many things in us, by yourself and from yourself, that these two works have come to an end in us, though quite late! Now, perform your work in us by yourself, for ourselves and without ourselves, as it pleases you, Lord. For as for me, henceforth, I fear nothing; I unburden myself of you, of myself, and of my neighbor, and I will tell you how: I abandon you, I abandon myself, and I abandon all my neighbors to the knowledge of your divine wisdom, to the power of your divine might, and to the governance of your divine goodness, and this, for your sole divine will. And only these divine things, annihilated, illuminated, and glorified by the divine majesty, have freed me from all things; and this without return, for otherwise, if something were lacking, it would not be a gift.

(The same, to the slaves of Reason and Nature, to make them envious:)
Now, if you wish and if you have received this gift, understand: I owe nothing, if Love is not a slave or if nothing is that cannot be; and when this is so, God then lives himself in this creature without her hindering him.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 93. Où l’on parle de la paix de la vie divine

[The author, to the listeners:] The peace of this life, which is the divine life, cannot be thought, spoken, or written, so much is the soul in this love without the work of the body, without that of the heart, without that of the spirit: it is through the divine work that it has fulfilled the Law. Reason indeed appreciates that Magdalene sought Jesus Christ, but Love remains silent. Note this well and do not forget it, for she lacked the divine life—which Truth calls the glorious life—as long as she was seeking Him.

But when she was in the desert, Love possessed and annihilated her, and thus Love henceforth did its work in her, for her, without her, and she henceforth lived the divine life which made her possess the glorious life. Henceforth, she found God within herself, without seeking Him; and besides, she had no need to, since Love had possessed her. But before Love possessed her, she sought Him through the desire of the will in a way of feeling according to the spirit, and for that reason, she was human and of humble condition, for she was lost, "married," and not Mary. She did not know, when she was seeking Him, that God is entirely everywhere; otherwise, she would not have sought Him. And I have found no one who always knew this, except the Virgin Mary: she never had a will through sensuality nor did she perform any work according to the spirit, but she had only the will of the divinity, which is born of the divine operation. To will only the divine will: that was, is, and will be her divine gaze, her divine nourishment, her divine love, her divine peace, her divine praise, all her labor and her rest. And that is why she received, without any intermediary in her soul, the glorious life of the Trinity in a mortal body.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 94. Du langage de la vie divine

[The author, to the listeners:] The language of this life, which is divine life, is the secret silence of divine love. She has come to it long ago if she has desired it for a long time. Here, there is no other life than to always desire the divine will.

Why delay in abandoning yourself? For no one can rest in supreme repose unless he is first exhausted, I am certain of it. Let the Virtues have what belongs to them in you, the sharp will and the heart of your spirit, until they have acquitted you of what you owe to Jesus Christ; this must be done before coming to Life.

In the name of God, understand what Jesus Christ himself says: does he not say in the Gospel that "whoever believes in me will do the works that I do, and will do even greater ones"? Where, I ask you, is the hidden meaning of this word? Until one has paid Jesus Christ all that one owes him, one cannot find the peace of the land of the divine state where Life dwells. May God quickly grant you the fulfillment of your natural perfection, the harmony of the soul's powers, and satisfaction in all things! This, you must have, for it is the path of divine life, which we call "glorious life." And this state of which we speak, of which Love, by its goodness, gives us the model, today brings the soul back to its first day: the one who is brought back today to his first day is the one who acquires on earth, through obedience to God, the innocence that Adam lost in the earthly paradise through disobedience. However, the pain remains with him: since Jesus Christ assumes it, it is only right that it remains with us.

The true innocents are never right and are never wronged; they are completely naked and have nothing to hide: all hide because of Adam's sin, but not those who are annihilated, for they have nothing to hide.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 95. Comment le pays des égarés est éloigné du pays de ceux qui

are annihilated
[The author, to the listeners:] The path is indeed long from the land of Virtues, enjoyed by those who are lost, to that of the forgotten and the annihilated in complete renunciation, or to that of the glorified in the highest state, where God is abandoned by Himself in Himself. He is then neither known, nor loved, nor praised by these creatures, except only in that He cannot be known, loved, or praised: such is the sum of all their love and the final stage of their journey. This final stage leads back to the first, for the intermediate stage does not deviate from it. Since this soul has completed it, it is just that it rests in Him who can do all that He wills by the goodness inherent in His divine being; thus, it can do all that it wills, without losing the gifts of Him who possesses His being inherently. And why not? Her gifts are as great as He who has given them, and this gift moves Him from Himself in Himself: He is Love itself, and Love can do all that it wills; however, neither Fear, nor Discernment, nor Reason can say anything against Love.
This soul, according to what it understands, lives in fullness; better yet: God lives in her without any hindrance on her part, and that is why the Virtues have no grounds to reproach her. Nevertheless, she speaks thus to God:

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 96. Où l’âme parle à la Trinité

The soul: Ah! Lord who can do all things! Ah! Master who knows all things! Oh! friends who are worth everything! Do all that you will! Dear Father, I can do nothing; dear Son, I know nothing; dear friends, I am worth nothing, and that is why I want nothing. In the name of God, let us never allow anything of ourselves or of others to enter into us, for which we would have to expel God from His goodness!

[The author, to the listeners 1:] There was once a creature who begged, and for a long time she sought God in His creature to see if she would find Him there as she wished, and as He would be Himself if the creature allowed Him to perform His divine works in her without hindrance; but she found nothing and remained, on the contrary, hungry for what she pursued. And when she saw that she had found nothing, she began to think; and in thinking, she said to herself that she must seek Him—and thus she pursued Him—in the depths of her understanding, through the purity of her lofty thought. And it was there that this begging creature went to seek Him, and she thought that she would write about God in the way she wanted to find Him in His creatures. And so she wrote what you hear, and she wanted her neighbor to find God in her, through her writings and her words; in other words, understand that she wanted her neighbor to be perfectly as she would have discoursed (at least all those to whom she wanted to say it!). But in doing, saying, and wanting this, she remained, know this, begging and encumbered by herself; and it was because she wanted to do so that she begged.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 97. Comment le paradis n’est pas autre chose que de voir Dieu

The most exalted Lady of Peace, she who lives a glorious life, or rather: from the very glory that exists only in paradise: Indeed, paradise is nothing other than seeing God alone; and that is why the thief was in paradise as soon as his soul left his body; even though Jesus Christ, the Son of God, did not ascend to heaven before the Ascension, he was, on the very day of Good Friday, in paradise. How can this be? It must be so, since Jesus Christ had promised it to him, and it is therefore true that he was there on that very day: it is because he saw God that he was in paradise and possessed it; for paradise is nothing other than seeing God. And someone is truly there as much and as often as they are unburdened of themselves; and this, not gloriously—for, for this creature, their body is too coarse—but divinely, for within, they are perfectly freed from all creatures; and that is why they live from glory, without intermediary, and they are in paradise without being there.

Seek the hidden meaning of these words if you wish to understand them, otherwise you will misunderstand them; indeed, they will seem somewhat contradictory to those who do not delve into the heart of this hidden meaning. But what only seems is not the truth: only the truth itself is, and nothing else.

But what was the soul thinking that wrote this book, in wanting one to find God in it to live what it would say? It seems that it wanted to take revenge, that is to say, it wanted creatures to beg from other creatures as it did itself!

The soul that wrote this book: Indeed, it is fitting to do so before one comes entirely to the state of freedom, I am quite certain. And yet, I was so foolish at the time when I made this book, or rather, at the time when Love made it for me at my request, that I valued something that could neither be done, nor thought, nor said, just like someone who would want to enclose the sea in their eye, carry the world on the tip of a reed, or illuminate the sun with a lantern or a torch. Yes, I was even more foolish,

When I valued what could not be said, And burdened myself with these words to write.

But thus I took my course And came to my rescue At the highest rung Of the state we speak of,

Which is in perfection,

when the soul remains in pure nothingness and without thought, and not before.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 98. Raison demande ce que font ceux dont l'état est au-dessus de

their thoughts
Reason: In the name of God, what do those whose state is above their thoughts do?
Love: They are seized by the One who is at the summit of His mountain, and thus they are seized by that very One who is at the bottom of their valley, by a non-thinking enclosed and sealed in the secret enclosure of the highest purity of this excellent soul; this enclosure, no one can open, nor unseal, nor close when it is open, unless the amiable Far-Near, at once very far and very near, closes or opens it: He alone holds the keys, and no one else carries them nor could carry them.
(To the liberated souls:) And you all, ladies, to whom God, in His divine goodness, has given this life abundantly and without return—and not only this life of which we speak, but also, with it, the One of whom no one has ever spoken—you will recognize in this book your exercise. As for the souls who are not such, nor were, nor will be, they will neither feel nor recognize this state; it is and will be impossible for them: they are not, know this, of the lineage of which we speak, no more than the angels of the first order are Seraphim nor can be, for God does not give them the state of the Seraphim. And the souls who are not yet such—except already in God, and that is why they will be one day—they will recognize this state and feel it even more strongly than they have known and felt it, due to the lineage to which they belong and will belong. But the people of whom we speak, who already are such and will be so again, they will recognize, as soon as they hear it, know this, the lineage to which they belong.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 99. Comment les gens qui sont en cet état sont en souveraineté sur

All things
[The author, to the listeners:] Those who are in this state hold sovereignty over all things. Indeed, the nobility of their spirit is that of the highest angelic order, as angels are created according to an ordered hierarchy. These people thus have the dwelling of the highest of all orders in terms of spirit, and the most noble complexion in terms of nature; for they are sanguine or choleric, and not melancholic or phlegmatic, and thus they possess the best share of fortune's gifts, for everything aligns with their will and necessity, for themselves as well as for their neighbor, without Reason's reproach. Listen then with envy to this great perfection of the annihilated souls of which we speak!

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 100. Comment il y a une grande différence entre les anges

Love: It is said, and I say it myself, that there is as great a difference in nature between the angels as there is between men and donkeys! It is easy to believe: divine wisdom has willed it so. And let no one ask why, if he wishes to believe rather than be mistaken, for that is the truth. And all that one would say about the angels among themselves, as you have heard, one would say, in terms of grace, about the difference between the annihilated ones we speak of and all those who are not.

They are very well born, those who are of this lineage; they are royal persons. Their ancestors are of excellent nobility and great destiny, and they could not perform works of little value, nor begin something that does not come to a good end; indeed, these persons are both the humblest they can be and the greatest they must be, as testified by Jesus Christ himself saying that the least shall be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. One must indeed believe it, but no one will believe it unless he is such: he who is such as what he believes, he truly believes it; but he who believes what he is not, it is because he does not live what he believes; and that one does not truly believe it, for the truth of believing is to be such as what one believes. And he who believes something is he who is such as what he believes: he has nothing more to do, neither with himself, nor with others, nor even with God, no more than if he were not, though he is. Understand the hidden meaning of this: it is in his will, that what is, is for him nothing more than if it were not.

In these three deaths is accomplished the perfection of this illuminated life. I call it illuminated in that it surpasses the annihilated life, which is blind: the blind soul supports the feet of the illuminated one, the latter being more noble and more lovable. She knows nothing of anyone, God or man, for she is not; but God knows it of himself, in himself, for herself and by herself. This lady never seeks God: she has no need and has nothing to do with him. He is not lacking to her; why then would she seek him? He who seeks is with himself, and thus possesses himself; but thus he lacks something, since he sets out to seek.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 101. Comment cette âme ne veut rien faire, si bien que rien ne lui

The soul: By God! Why would I do something my beloved would not do? He lacks nothing; what then could I lack? Truly, I would be mistaken if I lacked anything, since he lacks nothing: if he lacks nothing, I lack nothing! And this removes self-love from me, so that I give myself to him without intermediary and without restraint. I just said that he lacks nothing: what then could I lack? He seeks nothing: what then would I seek? He thinks of nothing: what then would I think?

(The same, annihilated and glorified by lack of self-love:) I will do nothing, Reason, but find someone who does something; and that, you will do, as I know you! But, thank God, I have no need of you. As for me, I am done with doing anything!

Reason: But since when? And at what moment?

The soul: Since the moment when Love opened his book to me. Indeed, this book is made in such a way that as soon as Love opens it, the soul knows everything; and thus it has everything, and thus every work of perfection is accomplished in it by the opening of this book. This opening made me see so clearly that it made me give back what is his and take back what is mine; that is to say, he is, and that is why he always possesses himself, whereas I am not, and that is why it is only right that I do not possess myself. And the light of the opening of this book made me find what is mine and remain in it; and that is why I do not have so much being that something of him could be in me. Thus the Just One, by justice, has given back to me what is mine, and shown me nakedly that I am not; and that is why he wants, by justice, that I do not possess myself: this justice is written in the heart of the Book of Life. This book and I are as God and the creatures were when he created them: when he willed it by his divine goodness, all was done instantly by his divine power, and all was ordered at the same moment by his divine wisdom.

[To the listeners:] In the name of God, look at what he did, what he does, and what he will do, and you will then find peace, a common peace, a sovereign peace, an absolute peace, itself invaded by such peace that the corruption of your complexion could never be a cause of punishment if you remain in it. My God! How beautiful and great these words are, for those who understand the truth of their hidden meaning!

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 102. Où Entendement-de-l’âme-anéantie montre combien il est

Pitiful it is that malice triumphs over goodness
Understanding-of-the-Annihilated-Soul: By God! Am I not already enough in the prison of corruption where I must be, whether I wish it or not, without also lodging myself in that of punishment? My God! What pity when malice triumphs over goodness! And this applies to both body and spirit. The spirit is created by God, and the body is formed by God; but these two natures, united for corruption according to nature and according to justice, escape punishment in the waters of baptism: these two natures are good, by the divine justice that made them. But when fault overcomes this complexion and this creation that divine goodness has made, there is nothing more pitiful, however small the fault; we then cast into bitterness the one who does not desire this, and we force him to unleash himself against us, for there is no small fault: what does not please the divine will, must displease it.
Knowledge of Divine Light: My God! Who dares to call this small? I claim that whoever names it "small," was neither well illuminated nor ever will be, unless he amends himself. But there is something graver still: he has scorned the good pleasure of his lord, in this negligence. There would be much to say about the difference between such a servant and the one who serves his lord in every way, and in all that he knows may please his will!

The soul: Some argue from what Scripture says that the righteous fall seven times a day. But what fools they would be if they understood this to mean in matters subject to punishment! Punishment is for those who fall into sin by the consent of their will; whereas corruption is due to the grossness of the complexion of our body. Otherwise, if we had to sin against our will seven times a day, it would seem that we do not have free will! This is not the case, thank God! For God would not be God if virtue were taken from me against my will. Indeed, just as God cannot sin, for He cannot will it, I cannot sin without my will consenting to it: in His love, my beloved has given me this freedom through His goodness. But if I wanted to sin, why would He not tolerate it? If He did not tolerate it, His power would take away my freedom; but His goodness could not bear that His power would take away my freedom in any way; in other words, it could not bear that any power would take away my will without my will consenting to it. His goodness has therefore given me, out of pure goodness, a free will: in all that He has done for me, He has given me nothing better; the rest, He has lent me out of courtesy, and if He takes it back, He does me no wrong; but my will, He has freely given to me, and that is why He cannot reclaim it unless it pleases my will. The master of love has given me such nobility in His goodness out of love, that never can the freedom of my will be taken from me if I do not wish it.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 104. Où l’âme dit comment Dieu lui a donné sa volonté libre

The Soul: See how God has freely given me my free will! I mentioned earlier that He has given me something else as well; but by saying this, one might understand that He has not given me everything, since He has only given me free will, and the other things, He has lent to me. Certainly, this would be a misunderstanding, for He has given me everything and could not have withheld anything without giving it to me, as Love confirms when it says that it would not be the love of the beloved otherwise. Indeed, by giving me free will through His pure goodness, He has given me everything, provided my will desires it: He possesses nothing else, I am certain of it.

Fear: In the name of God, Madame, in what way has He given you everything?

The Soul: In that I have freely given Him my will, without any reservation, in complete self-denial, for His goodness and His will alone, just as in His divine goodness, He gave it to me by His divine will for my benefit.

Now, I have said that God would not be God if virtue were taken from me against my will. This is true: there is nothing more certain than what God is, and nothing less certain than to claim that virtue could be taken from me without my will desiring it; and this is far from what Scripture says, that the righteous fall seven times a day in things subject to punishment!

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 105. Ce que veut dire que le juste tombe sept fois par jour

Truth: I will tell you what it means that the righteous falls seven times a day. It must be understood that, when the will of the righteous is wholly devoted, without any hindrance, to contemplating the divine goodness, the body is weak and prone to faults due to the inheritance of Adam's sin; and that is why it often inclines to desire something lesser than the goodness of God; and this, Scripture calls a "fall," for it is indeed one, but the will of the righteous refrains from consenting to the fault that could arise from this inclination. Thus, this fall where the righteous stumbles due to the aforementioned inclination is more a virtue than a vice, because of his will which remains free by refusing any fault, as has been said. Thus, you can understand how, from such heights, the righteous falls so low, and how this fall, even though it brings him very low, is more a virtue than a vice.

Now, understand: if the righteous falls seven times, it is because he is raised seven times, otherwise he could not fall seven times! He is truly blessed who often falls from such heights, for it means he comes from where truly no one goes unless they rightfully bear the name of righteous. And yet, even more blessed is he who always remains there! But no one can be there continually as long as the soul is accompanied in this world by this wretched body; however, this kind of fall does not cause the loss of peace in the reproaches or the remorse of conscience, so that the soul would no longer live in the peace of the gifts granted to it above the Virtues — not against the Virtues, but above them. And if this could not be, it would mean that God would be subject to his Virtues, and that the Virtues would be against the soul, they who hold their being from their lord and for his benefit.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 106. Comment l’âme déclare l’ensemble de ses demandes

The Soul: Now, I will declare all my requests: in them, all my petitions would be completely satisfied. Not that I know how to ask for what I ask or would like to ask, for the angels of all orders and the saints who belong to them do not know it: if they do not know it, the tenth state, which belongs to glory but to none of these nine orders, would not know how to ask for it either!

Reason: But you, Madame, do you know how to ask for anything?

The Soul: But yes, indeed!

Love: She can know it well through the divine nature of the attraction of her love, which forms her requests within her without her knowing it, so that her requests are foreign to any land where a creature can have knowledge.

The Soul: What is surprising about that? Why wouldn't there be someone other than me who knows it and who would thus be within me? This other is Secret Love, which is beyond all peace, where my love is anchored without myself. This attraction comes from his goodness towards me, which continually renews me in love. But because he is that of himself, in me and for me, and because I ask for it through the attraction of his pure nature without asking for it myself, I can know nothing of it; all those who are in glory do not do this, but only he who is one God in three persons.

Love: But in what she said about declaring all these requests, it must be understood that it is he who has what she has who will declare them; for in truth, what she has, no one other than God can say or think, he who operates in her continually by his own operation, without that of the soul and by his divine goodness.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 107. Où commencent les demandes de l’âme 1

The first thing she asks is to always see herself—if indeed she sees anything—where she was when, from nothing, God made everything; and thus, to be certain of being nothing other than that now and forever, insofar as it depends on her and assuming she never wrongs divine goodness.
The second request is to see what she has done with the free will that God had given her; and she will thus see that she has taken away her will from God Himself, in a single moment when she consented to sin. It must be understood that God hates all sin, and the one who consents to sin takes away their will from God: this is true, for they then do what God does not want and which is opposed to His divine goodness.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 108. Une belle considération pour éviter le péché

The Author: The soul must therefore consider the debt of a single one of its misdeeds, to see how much it owes for two, if it has fallen into it twice.

The Light of the Soul: Twice? Truly, no more than one could count the breaths I take, no more—far less, indeed!—could one count the times I have taken away God's will. As long as I had a will, I did nothing but that! Thus my will was lost, until I returned it in complete renunciation to the one who had freely given it to me in his goodness. Indeed, he who does good but sees an even greater good that he can do and is asked of him, if he does not do it, he sins. Consider then what you owe for a single one of your faults, and you will find that you owe God for it as much as his will is worth, you who have taken it from him by doing your own. To better understand this, consider what the will of God is: it is the entire Trinity, which is a single will. Thus, the will of God in the Trinity is a single divine nature, and the soul owes all of this to God for a single one of its faults.

We will make a comparison for those who understand in a worldly way. Suppose that this soul, which is nothingness, is now as rich as God: if it wanted to be free of the debt it owes for a single fault, and pay God no more and no less than what it owes him then, it would fall back into its nothingness and remain there; and that for having wanted to commit a single fault, and assuming that it is not nothingness by itself and that it has by nature what God has. Thus, even if it were fitting that it reduces itself to nothing according to the law, it would still have nothing left to be free of its fault in strict justice.

And if one can say this of a single sin, what then could Truth say if it wanted to speak of the others according to the law? It must nevertheless say it, for it is itself this law, and nothing else but it!

The Soul, responding to itself: Yes, Madam, if you possessed all that this book speaks of, even without giving anything to God, it would still belong to him as a debt and without you being free. — And how much do I owe for the other sins, when no one can count them, except Justice and Truth? — Alas, this debt, I owe it and will owe it endlessly and without discount! Indeed, even before owing anything, I already had nothing, you know and see it; for my will, God gave it to me to do his and thus to gain himself by himself... Alas! and I have added to my poverty the great poverty of sin! and of a sin that no one knows, except Truth alone!

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 109. Comment l’âme s’étonne de ne pouvoir suffisamment

To atone for her faults
The soul: My God, my God, my God! Who am I now, when I was already nothing before owing anything? Who am I if I was already nothing before owing my God something due to my own will? And while I would still be nothing without being acquitted of a single one of my faults—yes, a single one, no more!—if I had even that which this book speaks of in the comparison you have heard? And this or anything else, I neither have it nor can I have it within me! And if I had it, you see where I would be once acquitted of a single sin! Yes, I have never had anything and I cannot gain anything by myself, and no one can give me anything to pay my debts. Yes, Truth, who am I? I beg you, tell me!

Truth: You are nothing, and that even before having wronged me in what I have given you. You are even less than that, for you are less than nothing, as many times as you have willed something other than my will.

The soul that has done wrong: Yes, in all truth, I am nothing else, I know it well, and it is you, Truth, who have taught me this. And there is nothing I know better than this: if God adhered strictly to justice, without mercy for a single one of my sins, I should not suffer less than endless torments as great as His power. But if you, Upright Truth, if you are the strict and rigorous justice, there is Indulgence and Mercy, your sweet and courteous sisters, who will defend me before you for all my debts, and in this I find peace. Which among these sisters will come to my aid? It matters little to me: I entrust myself to her with all my will, whether she be Justice or Mercy, Truth or Indulgence. Yes, it matters little to me to fall into either of their two parties; all is equal to me, without joy or anxiety. And why without joy or anxiety? Because neither can come from the justice that would be applied to me, nor from the mercy that would be shown to me; thus I have neither joy from one, nor sorrow from the other. Since there is neither gain nor loss for my beloved, all is equal to me from the one who alone is Equality; and this makes me equal as well, whereas if it mattered to me, I would be immediately divided, for I would be with myself.

The Son of God the Father is my mirror in this, for God the Father gave us His Son in saving us; and in making us this gift, He considered nothing but our salvation alone. And the Son redeemed us by dying in obedience to His Father; in doing so, He considered nothing but His Father's will alone. As the Son of God is our example, we must follow Him by considering and willing in all things the divine will alone: thus we shall be sons of God the Father in the example of His Son Jesus Christ.

My God, how sweet it is to consider this will! He has made us capable of it: not that it is impossible for me to sin if I will it, but it is impossible for me to sin if my will does not will it. Thus we are fully capable of fulfilling His will if it remains in us without us seeking it elsewhere: who seeks what he possesses, it is due to a lack of knowledge, for lack of possessing the art that gives this science.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 110. Comment l’art 1, en la créature, est une habileté subtile, qui

is in the substance of the soul
She who seeks: What then is the art in the creature?
Love: It is a subtle skill from which understanding is born, and which grants the soul the knowledge by which one comprehends what is said more perfectly than the one who says it, regardless of their understanding of what they say. This is because the one who understands rests, while the one who speaks labors; thus, knowledge cannot endure labor without becoming less noble.
This art is agile, and therefore it naturally strives to achieve the fullness of what it undertakes. What it undertakes is the just will of God, neither more nor less. This subtle skill is the substance of the soul, while knowledge is its pinnacle, for it is made of substance and understanding.
[The author:] This soul harbors within itself all that constitutes a life of good morals, and that is why Love dwells within it and grants it to be thus; but it remains in nothingness, and not in love. Indeed, as long as it remains in love, the soul possesses itself; and as long as it remains there, this love makes it proud and frivolous: for Nature accompanies this love, so much so that in this state there is often something to give and take, which makes the soul possessive and proud. It then engages in distinct considerations and meditations, which is proper to the state of contemplation, which keeps Thought close by for assistance. But now that this soul remains in nothingness because Love dwells within it, this state no longer has a hold on it, and thus, nothing within it makes it sad or frivolous, for Thought no longer has dominion over it.
It has lost the use of its senses—not its senses, but their use—because Love has removed it from the place where it was, leaving them in peace, and thus has taken away this use: this is the fulfillment of its pilgrimage and its return to nothingness by the restitution of its will when it vanishes within it. This is a capture of the high seas! for it lives without the will of its will, so that it is in a state that surpasses its own counsel; otherwise, it would incur the reproaches of the sovereign who places this will outside of it, and it would then be at war with Love—who is the Holy Spirit—and would incur the reproaches of the Father and the judgment of the Son.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 111. De la différence entre l’onction de paix et la guerre que fait le

Reproach or Remorse of Conscience
Love: There is indeed a great difference between the anointing of peace, which surpasses all understanding and abides in the delights of the full satisfaction given by the beloved through the union of love, and this war waged by reproach. The one who remains with will often knows this war, no matter how good the works of this will may be; whereas the one who remains in ‹rien-vouloir›, where he was before possessing the will, is at peace: divine goodness has nothing to reproach him for.
The Liberated Soul: My God! How well said! But the beloved must do this without myself, just as he created me without myself in his divine goodness. Indeed, I am a soul created by him without myself, to carry out from him to me the difficult works of the Virtues, he for me and I for him, until I am again in him; but I cannot be in him unless he places me there by himself and without myself, just as he made me by himself and without myself. He is the Uncreated Goodness who loves the goodness he has created; now, the Uncreated Goodness possesses in itself a free will, and to us too it gives by its goodness a free will, external to its power, without any "why", except for ourselves and so that we may be by this goodness. Thus we have a will that emanates from his goodness and is external to his power, so that we may be freer, just as his will is external to our power in its own freedom.
But the divine Goodness saw that we would go in the way of misfortune and perdition because of the free will that God has given us and which emanates from his goodness, a goodness given to us by goodness; so much so that human nature united with it in the person of the Son, to pay for the evil we have committed through the disobedience of our will.
Disobedient Will: Thus I can no longer be what I must be, until I am again where I was, and as I was before coming out of God as naked as he is, he who is; yes, as naked as I was when I was the one who was not. And I must have this if I want to regain what is mine; otherwise, I will not have it.
[The Author:] Understand the hidden meaning of this if you will, but especially if you can; if you cannot, it is because you are not there, for if you were there, you would be open to it. If you have the capacity to listen to this, it is because you are not annihilated to that extent—otherwise, I do not say. And if his goodness has taken away your ability to listen, I do not contradict it.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 112. De la bonté éternelle qui est amour éternel

[The author:] He has an eternal goodness which is eternal love; and by its nature of charity, it tends to give and spread all its goodness. This eternal goodness begets a communicable goodness; from this eternal goodness and this communicable goodness proceeds the intimate love of the lover in the beloved; and the beloved continually gazes upon her lover in this intimate love.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 113. Que penser à la passion de Jésus-Christ fait avoir victoire sur

[The author:] I make it known to all who will hear this book that we must reproduce in ourselves as much as we can—through devout thoughts, through works of perfection, through the demands of Reason—all the life that Jesus Christ led and preached to us. For he indeed said, as mentioned earlier: "Whoever believes in me will do the works that I do, and will do even greater ones." This we must do to gain victory over ourselves. And if we did this as much as we could, we would come to possess him while putting outside of ourselves all thoughts, all works of perfection, and all demands of Reason, for we would have no need of them: the divinity would then operate in us, for ourselves and without ourselves, its divine works. God is what he is; that is why he is what he is by himself: lover, beloved, love.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 114. Si la créature humaine peut demeurer en vie tout en étant sans

[The author:] I ask the blind, or those who are illuminated and see better than they, if the human creature can remain alive while being without itself. If those do not tell me, no one will, for no one knows it unless they are of this lineage.
Truth, for its part, answers yes; and Love underscores it by saying that the annihilated soul is without itself when it no longer feels in any way either nature, or its operation, or any inner work, nor shame, nor honor, nor any fear of anything that may happen, nor any affection towards divine goodness, when it no longer harbors any will, but is rather perpetually without will: it is then annihilated, without itself, whatever God may tolerate from it; it then does all things without itself, and thus leaves all things without itself. This is not surprising: it is no longer for itself, for it lives from divine substance.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 116. Comment l’âme se réjouit de l’épreuve de son prochain

The author: This soul sees in her beloved a complete and perfect love; thus she seeks no occasion to have his help, but rather takes his interests as her own. She sometimes rejoices, unbeknownst to herself in her higher part, whether she wills it or not, in the trials of her neighbor, for she sees in her spirit and knows without knowing that this is the path by which he will reach the harbor of his salvation.

This soul sees her own light at the sublime point where union is made, and thus she delights in the pleasure of the one to whom she is united; indeed, his pleasures are the salvation of creatures. She is united to the will of her beloved, and therefore finds her joy in his goodness, due to the accord by which his goodness has thus united her to him unbeknownst to Reason. But by this very fact, Reason now perceives her joy, and tells her that it is a sin to rejoice in the trial of her neighbor: Reason always judges according to what she knows, for she always wants to do the work that belongs to her; but here, she is one-eyed and cannot see high enough, and that is why she thus complains to the soul. Yes, Reason is one-eyed, there is no denying it, for no one can see elevated things unless he is to be eternal; thus, in all justice, Reason cannot see this, for her being must disappear.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 117. Comment cette âme montre qu’elle est l’exemple du salut de

every creature
The Most High Spirit, who is no longer under the dominion of Reason: But now, God has no place to bestow His goodness except in me; He has no proper refuge and can find no place to wholly reside, except in me; and in this, I am an example of salvation, and not merely an example, but moreover, the very salvation of every creature and the glory of God. I will tell you how, why, and in what way: it is because I am the sum of all evils!
Indeed, by my very nature, I contain what is evil, and thus I am all malice; whereas He who is the sum of all goods contains within Himself and by His very nature all goodness, and thus He is all goodness. Thus, I am all malice and He is all goodness. Now, it is to the poorest that one must give alms, lest one deprive them of what is rightfully theirs; and God cannot be unjust without denying Himself. Therefore, His goodness is myself, due to my necessity and the justice of His pure goodness: since I am all malice and He is all goodness, I must have all His goodness so that my malice may be absorbed! My poverty cannot be satisfied with less! And His goodness could not bear that I should beg, for it is powerful and strong; whereas I would necessarily have to beg if He did not give me all His goodness, for I am all malice; and nothing less than the fullness of the abundance of all His goodness can fill the abyss of my own malice. By this means, I thus receive within myself all His divine goodness, from His pure goodness and by goodness; I have received it without beginning and I will receive it without end, for He has always known this necessity, and in this, I have always received it in the knowledge of His divine wisdom, by the will of His pure divine goodness and by the operation of His divine power. Otherwise, if He had not always acted thus towards me, I would no longer exist. And it is in this that I say that I am the salvation of every creature and the glory of God: just as Christ, by His death, is the redemption of the multitude and the praise of God the Father, I am, due to my malice, the salvation of humankind and the glory of God the Father. Indeed, God the Father has given all His goodness to His Son, and this goodness of God is made known to humankind in the death of His Son Jesus Christ, who is eternally the praise of the Father and the redemption of the human creature.
The soul: I tell you likewise that God the Father has poured all His goodness into me, and He has given it to me. This goodness of God is made known to humankind through malice; hence it is clearly apparent that I am eternally the praise of God and the salvation of the human creature, for the salvation of every creature is nothing other than the knowledge of the goodness of God: since all will know through me the goodness of God who grants me this goodness, it will thus be known to them through me, and it would never have been known if not for my malice. Since divine goodness is known to them through my malice, and their salvation is nothing other than knowing divine goodness, I am thus the cause of the salvation of every creature in that the goodness of God is known to them through me; and since the goodness of God is known through me, I am His sole glory and His sole praise, for His glory and His praise are nothing other than the knowledge of His goodness: our salvation and all His will consist in nothing else, indeed, than in knowing His divine goodness, of which I am the cause, since the goodness of His pure nature is known through the malice of my cruel nature, and I have no other reason to possess His goodness than my own malice.
Nor can I ever lose His goodness, for I cannot lose my malice; and this point has assured me without any doubt of His pure goodness. And the very nature of my malice has thus adorned me with this gift, and not a work of goodness that I would have ever done or that anyone could have done: none of that gives me comfort or hope, but only my malice, for it is through it that I hold this certainty.
Thus you have seen—and you can see if there is in you a bit of light—how, in what way, and why I am the salvation of every creature and the glory of God. And since I receive all His goodness, I am thus that very thing which He is by transformation of love, for the stronger transforms the weaker into itself. This transformation is rich with many delights: they know it, those who have tried it! But if the pupil of the eye is the most fragile thing—fearing the slightest foreign body, whether it be fire, iron, or stone, which would be its death—divine love is even more vulnerable to anything that can be opposed to it when one does not always adhere to the fullness of its pure will.
You can now understand how my malice is the cause of receiving His goodness on account of the necessity I have for it. Indeed, God sometimes allows some evil to be accomplished for a greater good that must be born from it afterward, and all those who are created by the Father and come into this world have descended from perfection to imperfection to attain the greatest perfection: there is opened the wound that will heal those who were unknowingly wounded. These people have humbled themselves and have borne the cross of Jesus Christ in the work of goodness by which they bear their own.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 118. Des sept états de l’âme dévote, que l’on appelle aussi « êtres1

The Soul: I promised, as soon as Love cast its hold, to say something about the seven states that we call "beings," for they are seven. These are the steps by which one ascends from the valley to the summit of the mountain so isolated that one sees only God, and each step is established in a particular state.

[The Author:] The first state, or step, is that the soul, touched by God through grace and stripped of its power to sin, intends to keep, at the cost of its very life—meaning, even if it should die—the commandments that God gives in the Law. Nevertheless, this soul regards and considers with great respect that God has commanded it to love Him with all its heart, and its neighbor as itself. This seems to it a great labor compared to what it can do, and it seems to it that if it were to live a thousand years, its power would suffice only to hold and keep the commandments.

The Free Soul: At this point and in this state, I once found myself for a time. But no one fears to reach the summit if their heart is generous and inwardly filled with noble courage; only a mean heart dares not undertake great things nor climb higher, for lack of love: this is cowardice, and it is not surprising among people who remain in such sloth that does not allow them to seek God; indeed, they will never find Him if they do not seek Him diligently.

[The Author:] The second state, or step, is that the soul considers what God advises His intimate friends, beyond what He commands; for one is not a friend who can refrain from doing all that he knows pleases his friend. Thus, the creature abandons itself and strives to act above all human counsel, in works that mortify nature, in the contempt of riches, delights, and honors, to perfectly fulfill the counsels of the Gospel, of which Jesus Christ is the model. Thus, it fears neither the loss of what it has, nor the words of people, nor the weakness of the body, for its beloved did not fear them, and the soul invaded by Him cannot fear them either.

The third state is that the soul considers itself in the affection of love for the work of perfection, where its spirit decides, through a fervent desire of love, to multiply these works within itself; this is done through the subtle knowledge of the understanding of its love, which can offer its beloved nothing else to comfort him but what he loves. Indeed, nothing has value in love but to give the beloved the most loved thing.

Now, the will of this creature loves only works of goodness, through the difficulty of its great undertakings in all the labors with which it can nourish its spirit. Hence, it rightly seems to it that it loves only works of goodness; and yet, it can give nothing to Love if it does not sacrifice it to Him; indeed, no death would be a martyrdom to it, except that which consists in abstaining from the work it loves, that is, from the delights of its good pleasure and the life according to the will that feeds on it. And that is why it abandons such works where it finds such great delights, and puts to death the will that took life from them; and it obliges itself, to be a martyr, to obey the will of another by abstaining from work and will, and by fulfilling the will of another to destroy its own will. And this is more difficult, much more difficult, than the two aforementioned states, for it is more difficult to overcome the works of the will of the spirit than to overcome the will of the body or to do the will of the spirit. Thus, one must crush oneself, by breaking and shattering oneself, and thus enlarge the place where Love will want to dwell; and one must encumber oneself with many states to unencumber oneself and to reach one's state.

The fourth state is that the soul is absorbed by the elevation of love in the delights of thought through meditation, and that it is detached from all outward labors and obedience to others through the elevation of contemplation; this makes the soul so fragile, so noble, and so delightful, that it cannot bear to be touched by anything except the pure delight of Love, which it enjoys with singular grace. This touch makes it proud in the abundance of love, for it is master of it through the brilliance, that is, through the clarity, of its soul which wonderfully fills it with love, in great faith and by the concord of the union that has put it in possession of its delights.

The soul then claims that there is no higher life than to possess this, of which it has lordship; indeed, Love has so greatly satisfied it with its delights, that it does not believe that God can make a greater gift to a soul here below than this love that Love has poured into it out of love.

Yes, it is not surprising that this soul is overwhelmed, for Gracious Love completely intoxicates it, so much so that it understands nothing else but Him, because of the strength with which Love delights it. And yet, the soul cannot appreciate another state; indeed, the great clarity of Love has so dazzled its sight, that it leaves it nothing to see beyond its love. But there, it is mistaken, for there are two other states that God gives here below, which are greater and nobler than this one; but Love has deceived many souls because of the sweetness of the enjoyment of its love, which overwhelms the soul as soon as it approaches it! And no one can oppose this force: the soul knows this, which, through pure love, has exalted Love beyond itself.

The fifth state is that the soul considers that God is, He who is and from whom all things derive their being, and that it itself is not and is therefore not that from which all things derive their being. And these two considerations give it a wondrous astonishment: it sees that He is all goodness, He who has placed a free will in it which is not, except as entire malice.

Now that divine goodness has placed in the soul a free will by pure divine goodness, what is not—except as malice and which is therefore entirely malice—contains within itself the free will of the being of God, of Him who is the Being and who wants what has no being to have being in this gift that He gives it. And that is why divine goodness spreads before it, through the movement of divine light, an overflow that ravishes the soul. This movement of divine light, spread as light within the soul, shows its will the equality of soul of what is and gives it the knowledge of what is not, to remove it from the place where it is and where it should not be, and to put it back where it is not and where it came from, where it should be.

Now, this Will sees, through the light of the overflow of divine light (light which is given to this Will to put it back in God, for it cannot return there without it), that it cannot benefit itself if it does not separate from its own will; indeed, its nature is bad, due to the inclination that leads it to nothingness, and the will has reduced it to less than nothing. Thus, the soul sees this inclination and this perdition of the nothingness of its nature and its own will, and thus sees in the light that its Will must will only the sole divine will, and no other, and that it is for this that this Will was given to it. And that is why the soul withdraws from its own will, and the Will withdraws from this soul to put itself back in God, to give and surrender itself to Him where it was taken from the beginning, without retaining anything of its own, to accomplish the perfect divine will; this cannot be accomplished in the soul without this gift, unless it is either at war or failing; and this gift operates in it this perfection and thus transforms it into the nature of Love, which delights it with a perfect peace and satisfies it with a divine nourishment. Yet, it no longer guards against warring in its nature, for its will is returned stripped to where it was taken and where it should be by justice; whereas it was always at war as long as it retained within itself the Will outside of its being.

Now, this soul is therefore "nothing," for it sees through the abundance of divine knowledge its nothingness which makes it null and reduces it to nothing. And thus it is whole, for it sees through the depth of the knowledge of its malice, which is so deep and so great that it finds neither beginning, nor measure, nor end, but an abyssal and bottomless abyss; there it finds itself without finding itself and without encountering a bottom. Indeed, it is not found, that which cannot be reached; and the more it sees itself in this knowledge of its malice, the more it truly knows that it cannot know it, not even the smallest point that makes this soul an abyss of malice, a chasm where it shelters and spreads, like sin in the flood, which contained all perdition. This is how this soul sees itself without seeing it. But who makes it see itself? It is the depth of Humility, which places it on the throne and reigns without pride: there, pride cannot penetrate, since it sees itself without seeing itself. And this non-seeing makes it see itself perfectly.

Now, this soul is established at the bottom, where there is no bottom, which makes it so low; and this abasement makes it see very clearly the true sun of the highest goodness, for it has nothing to prevent it from seeing it. This divine goodness shows itself to it through the goodness that absorbs, transforms, and unites it by union of goodness in the pure divine goodness, of which Goodness is the mistress. And the knowledge of the two natures we have spoken of, namely of divine goodness and of its malice, is the science that has endowed it with this goodness. And because the Bridegroom of its youth wants only one thing, He who is one, Mercy has made peace with firm Justice by having transformed this soul into its goodness. Thus, it is both whole and not at all, for its beloved makes it one.

Now, this soul has fallen from love into nothingness, a nothingness without which it cannot be whole. This fall is so deep, if it has fallen well, that the soul cannot rise from such an abyss; it should not do so, but rather remain there: it is there that the soul loses its pride and its youth, for its spirit is now an old man who no longer leaves it to enjoyment and frivolity. Indeed, the Will has withdrawn from it, which often made it, through the sentiment of love, proud, haughty, and possessive in the elevation of the contemplation of the fourth state. But the fifth state has set it right by showing it to itself. Now, it sees by itself and knows divine goodness, knowledge that makes it see itself in return; and these two visions take away from it the will, the desire, and the work of goodness, so that it is entirely at rest and placed in possession of a state of freedom that rests it from all things in an excellent nobility.

The sixth state is that the soul does not see itself, whatever abyss of humility it may have within it, nor does it see God, whatever highest goodness may be His. But God sees Himself then in it, through His divine majesty which illuminates this soul with Himself, so that it sees nothing that can be outside of God Himself, He who is and from whom all things derive their being. What is, is God Himself, and yet, it sees nothing but itself, for he who sees what is, sees only God Himself seeing Himself in this very soul through His divine majesty. Then the soul is in the sixth state, freed from all things, pure and illuminated—but not glorified, for glorification is in the seventh state; we will possess it in glory and no one can speak of it. However, this soul thus pure and enlightened sees neither God nor itself, but God sees Himself through Himself in it, for it, without it. And God shows it that there is nothing that can be outside of Him. That is why it knows only Him, so that it loves only Him and praises only Him, for there is nothing that can be outside of Him. Indeed, what is, is by His goodness; and God loves His goodness, wherever He has given it by goodness; and His given goodness is God Himself, and God cannot withdraw from His goodness without it remaining with Him; that is why what is, is goodness, and goodness is what God is. And yet, Goodness sees itself through its goodness in the divine light of the sixth state where the soul is illuminated. Thus, there is nothing that is outside of Him who is and who sees Himself in this being through His divine majesty, in the transformation of love of the goodness spread and returned to Him. And yet, He sees Himself through Himself in this creature without giving it anything of its own: everything is proper to it and is itself proper.

Such is the sixth state that we had promised to tell the listeners as soon as Love cast its hold; and Love has itself paid this debt in its high nobility.

As for the seventh state, Love keeps it within itself to give it to us in eternal glory: we will not know it until our soul has left our body.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 119. Comment l’âme qui a fait écrire ce livre s’excuse de l’avoir

so long in words, although it seems short and brief to the souls who dwell in nothingness and who have come to this state through love.

The soul who had this book written: Yes, ladies, you who are unknown in every way, you who are in being without separating from the Being in any known way, truly, you are unknown in every way! But this holds true in the land where Reason holds dominion. I apologize to all of you who dwell in nothingness and who have arrived at this state through love, for I have made this book quite lengthy in words, although it seems very small to you, as far as I can understand you. Please excuse me, by your courtesy, for necessity makes law. I did not know to whom to declare what I could understand; but now, I acknowledge, for your peace and for the truth, that it is indeed very low! It is Cowardice that led it, which rendered understanding to Reason through Love's answers to its questions, so that it was made according to human science and human wisdom, whereas human reason and human wisdom know nothing of inner love, nor does inner love know anything of divine science: my heart is absorbed so high and engulfed so low that I cannot reach it, for all that can be said, written, and thought—which is more than saying—about God, is rather lying than telling the truth.

I have said that Love had this written through human science and in wanting the transformation of my understanding, for I was burdened by it, as is evident from this book; indeed, Love did it by unburdening my spirit in the three gifts we have mentioned. And that is why I declare that it is indeed very low and very small, however great it seemed to me when I began to show this state.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 120. Comment Vérité fait l’éloge de ces âmes

Truth, praising the souls who are in this state:

O emerald, precious stone,
True diamond, queen, empress,
You give everything in your fine nobility, Without asking Love for its riches,
But only the will of its divine pleasure. This is indeed just,
For it is the true path
Of Pure Love, to wish to adhere to it.
O very deep well and well-sealed source, Where the sun is subtly hidden,
You cast your rays through divine science;
This, we know through true wisdom,
For it is its brilliance that always makes us shine.

The soul:

O Truth, in the name of God,
Do not say that of myself,
I never speak of him,
Anything that is not given by him;
And this is indeed true, do not doubt it,
For never, in this, have I had a mistress.
If it pleases you to know to whom I belong,
I will say it out of pure courtesy:
Love, at such a point, has taken me under its tutelage, That I have neither sense, nor will,
Nor reason to do anything,
Except, know this, through him alone.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 121. Où Sainte-Eglise fait l’éloge de cette âme

Holy Church:
Courteous and well-instructed, that is well said! You are the true star, who indicates the day,
The pure sun without blemish, without trace of impurity,
The full moon, never hiding; You are the oriflamme, who precedes the king.
You live on the single grain, with no other desire, While those who live on straw, bran, coarse fodder,
Are still driven by human will:
They are servants of the Law; she is above the Law, But not against the Law: Truth bears witness.
She is full and satisfied: God is her will.
The Soul:
Yes, dearest Divine Love, who are in Trinity,
Such is my happiness, that I marvel at how those can endure
Who are governed by Reason, and Fear, Desire, Deed, and Will,
Without knowing the great nobility of remaining silent. The Holy Trinity:
O stone from heaven,
I pray you, dear daughter: why worry about it?
There is no great scholar in the world who could speak to you of it;
You were at my table, I gave you my sustenance; Thus you are well-instructed,
and you savor well my sustenance,
My wines from the full vat, with which you are so filled, That merely by smelling them, you became intoxicated; And you will never change again.
You have thus tasted my sustenance And savored the new wine:
No one but you could speak of it;
Thus you could not, no matter the price offered,
Devote your heart to another pursuit.
If it pleases you, my dear daughter,
My sister, my beloved,
I pray you by love:
Do not reveal The secrets you know;
Others would be damned Where you will be saved,
Since Reason and Desire govern them,
And Fear, and Will.
But know this, my chosen daughter:
Paradise is given to them.
The chosen soul: Paradise? Do you not grant it to them otherwise? Even murderers will have it, if they cry for mercy! But I will not remain silent just because you wish it, and that is why I will recite the verses of a song with the permission of ‹Fin Amour›.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 122. Où l’âme commence sa chanson

The Soul: Behold the ascension into the heights, the most precious entry and the worthy abode that the sweet humanity of the Son of God our Savior grants to the human creature, humanity that the divinity has established in high possession of paradise, up there, at the right hand of God the Father, united for us with the Son: for all this, yes, be amazed! Give Him thanks and gratitude, for on that day too, He gave me ‹Fin Amour›. And this, thanks to whom? Thanks to myself, to my neighbor, and to the whole world, thanks to the spiritual affection and the Virtues of which I had been a slave by my submission to the power of Reason. I will tell you the truth here: Considering the foolishness in which I remained In that time when I served them, Surely I could not Express it to you with all my heart! And while I served them, While I preferred them, Here is the joy that Love gave me: I heard someone speak of it! And as simple as I was, Even though I esteemed it poorly, Love made me want to love it. And when Love saw me thinking of it because of the Virtues, it did not refuse me, but rather withdrew me from their humble service to lead me to the divine school, and there it kept me without any service, and there I was satisfied and fulfilled. Thinking is worth nothing here, Neither working, nor speaking. Love lifts me so high — Thinking is worth nothing here — By its divine gazes, That I have no desire. Thinking is worth nothing here Neither working, nor speaking. Love, in its nobility, Has made me find the verses of my song. It sings of pure divinity Of which Reason cannot speak, And my only beloved: He has no mother, But he comes from God the Father, And also from God the Son. His name is the Holy Spirit: My heart is so united to Him, That He makes me live in joy. The beloved, in that he loves me, Gives me here his nourishment. I do not want to ask him for anything, For that would be great malice. I must rather wholly trust In this love of my lover. O beloved, to the amiable nature, There is much to praise you for! Generous and courteous beyond measure, Summit of all goodness, You no longer wish to do anything, Beloved, without my will. So I must not keep silent About your beauty, your goodness: You are for me powerful and wise; This, I cannot hide. Alas, alas! But to whom then shall I say it? Even a Seraphim cannot speak of it! O beloved, you have possessed me in your love, To give me your great treasure, Which is to give yourself, You, the divine goodness. And if the heart cannot say it, A pure nothing-wanting guesses it, Which has lifted me so high, By a union of heart to heart That I must never reveal. I was once confined in the slavery of a prison, When Desire locked me in the want of affection. There the light of the ardor of divine love found me; It immediately killed my desire, my will, and my affection, Which prevented me from being taken into the heart of divine love. And the divine light brought me out of prison: Its nobility united me to the divine will of Love, Where the Trinity gives me the delights of its love. This gift, no man knows, As long as he serves one or the other Virtue, Which he feels through Nature or exercises in Reason. O beloved, what will the ‹béguines›, the religious people say, Hearing the excellence of your divine song? The ‹béguines› declare that I am lost, And the priests too, the clerics and the preachers, The Augustinians, the ‹cannes› and the Friars Minor! For the state I speak of is perfect love, Without saving their Reason which makes them say that. Desire, Will, and Fear certainly take away from them the knowledge, The richness and the union of the high light Of the ardor of divine love. Truth declares it to my heart: I am loved by one alone. It says that it is without return That he has given me his love. This gift kills my thought Of the delights of his love, Delights that exalt and transform me by union Into the eternal joy of being in divine Love. Divine Love tells me that it has entered into me, So well that it can do all it wants: The strength it has given me, It is from the beloved whom I hold in love; To him I am devoted, And he wants me to love him, So well that I will love him. I said: I will love him; I lie, I am not! He alone loves me: He is, I am not! And nothing else matters to me, Except all that he wants, Except all that he is worth. He is in fullness: I receive fullness from it; This is the divine heart And our loyal loves. EXPLICIT HERE FOLLOW SOME CONSIDERATIONS FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN THE STATE OF THE LOST AND WHO ASK FOR THE WAY TO THE LAND OF FREEDOM

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 123. La première considération porte sur les apôtres

I wish to offer some considerations for those who are lost and seeking the path to the land of freedom, considerations that greatly benefited me when I was among the lost, living on milk and porridge, and still acting foolishly. These considerations helped me endure and withstand the time when I was straying from the path, and they served me in finding that path; indeed, it is through asking that one can go far, it is through asking that one finds the path and finds it again if one has strayed from it.

First, I asked my mind why Jesus Christ said this to his apostles: "It is necessary that I go away, and if I do not go away, truly you will not be able to receive the Holy Spirit." And I then received an answer from Justice, who told me that Jesus Christ said this to them because they loved him too tenderly according to human nature, and too weakly according to his divine nature. That is why he said, "It is necessary that I go away." This was hard for them to hear, but through this hardship, they could recognize their love and see that it was natural and not divine. The truth of what they heard was neither hard nor strange to them, but they were troubled according to their understanding; and rightly so, for they were also coarse in their love. Nevertheless, they still possessed the sweet grace of God, for that love does not separate one from the grace of God—in fact, it is in his grace that one possesses it—but it prevents the gifts of the Holy Spirit, for they can only endure pure divine love, without any mixture of nature.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 124. La seconde considération porte sur la Madeleine1

Next, I considered the gentle Madeleine, and what service was hers at the coming of Jesus Christ, her guest. He often came to Mary's house because of the great familiarity she had with him and his apostles; but it was not for nothing that he came, for Mary did not move, whatever task there was to do. And supposing that Our Lord Jesus Christ often returned with heavy legs, his blessed head all weary, supposing he was completely fasting, all tired and rejected by everyone—indeed, he found no one to give him food and drink—and that Madeleine knew all this, nevertheless, whatever was lacking to his body, she did not move and relied on her sister Martha to serve him, for it was her duty; but to love him, she relied only on herself!

I also considered Mary when she sought Our Lord Jesus Christ at the tomb; she did not find him there, but found two angels who spoke to her, offering to comfort her. But Mary received no comfort from them, no more than if the shadows of the two angels had offered themselves to her: Mary sought the true sun who created the angels, and that is why she could not receive comfort from the angels!

My God! Mary, to be such in seeking and loving humanly with the affection of a tenderness invaded by your spirit, what a beloved you must have been when you sought nothing more, but were placed in divine love without the affection of your spirit!

After that, I considered how Mary cultivated the land her lord had given her: she sowed pure wheat there; this wheat united with this cultivation, and the master then made it bear fruit a hundredfold; but this was not before Mary had done what she could and should do.

And when she had done what she could and should towards God who asked it of her, and who for this purpose had created her by himself but for herself, then Mary rested without doing any work of her own; and God did his work gently in Mary, for Mary, without Mary. Indeed, Mary had done what was her part, and the rest no longer depended on her, but on the master who had given her this land to till.

Now, I will tell the children—and not the wise—how this came about.

When a man owns land and necessity invites him to find his sustenance there, he tills it, cultivates it, and weeds it in the way he thinks it will yield better, so that it bears the wheat that must be sown there and that the one who tills and sows may live from it. These two things must necessarily be done before the man can reap the fruit of his land for his sustenance. But when the wise farmer has cultivated his land, weeded it, and sown it with wheat, all his power can do nothing more; he must rather let God arrange everything if he wants to enjoy his work, for by himself, he can do nothing more: natural wisdom shows you this. Now the wheat must rot in the ground before it can yield any new fruit from which the farmer can receive help, whatever his work has been. How this grain rots, how it is reborn bearing fruit a hundredfold in great multiplication, no one knows, except God who does it alone after the farmer has done what is his, but not before.

Truly, I tell you the same of Mary. The land that Mary worked was her body, which she put to the test in the impetuous and marvelous operations of her ardent desires: they made it run over its land, tilling it through works of goodness; it was through them that she worked in everything she knew her land could better bear the true seed of God's grace. Indeed, a single good work does not engender virtues, but many works truly ensure them, and perfect works produce them; that is why Mary needed many works for the virtues to be perfect in her.

Now, you have heard how Mary worked by her tilling the land that God had given her to cultivate. So I will tell you about the pure wheat that Mary sowed in her tilling. In reality, it is the pure intention she directed to God, for it would be too much for the work to be bad and bear no fruit if the intention is truly for the love of God. This intention, she had in everything she did, for her affection was always in God for the love of whom she tilled and sowed the land he had given her to work.

This work, she received it because of the fault of sin, so that through it, the great irregularities that were in her might be smoothed out. Now, you might ask how it is possible that a work of goodness done with right intention can be in the soul because of the fault of sin; it was not always and everywhere the case: if this work was in Jesus Christ, it was for the fault of humankind, whereas if it is in us, it is truly because of our fault, even if the blind call this life true perfection, and it is named thus for those who do not see and could not truly understand it. But those who have two eyes call it "fault of sin," and undoubtedly it is so, for just as the child must have in him and do the works of the child before being a perfect man, similarly must the man act foolishly and madly in his human works before possessing the true heart of the state of freedom, a state where the soul operates in a divine exercise and without its own operation.

And this divine exercise prevents and restrains us from working in ourselves certainly because of our fault, in good works as in bad.

So you have just heard that the good work is a fault of sin; I will now tell you why: it is because the lesser takes the place of the greater, and because of our fault, the lesser establishes itself at its convenience, and this lesser makes us lose the noble divine state. Indeed, because we have in us good works, which is the lesser, we cannot at the same time have the noble divine state, for they cannot dwell together: the latter is too great to bear a foreign guest in its company. But Mary had to have this lesser because of the fault you have heard: she had this work of goodness so ardently, she took it on so much and burdened herself with it so strongly, that this burden truly unburdened her of herself.

Thus Mary tilled and sowed her land: the tilling is the hard works of perfection; and the seed is the pure intention. These two works, we owe them because of our fault, but our work cannot penetrate further, and that is why God must do the rest; and so he does, this is clearly evident in Mary. Indeed, after her work, when she had done what belonged to her, she was unburdened of herself, so much so that God had to do the rest, without her, for her, in her: since she had done what she had to do and what belonged to her, she let God dispose of her entirely. And we should do the same. Now, how her work benefited her and through her, and how Mary found life in what she received the fruit a hundredfold in great multiplication, no one knows, except God who alone operates this multiplication. This work, he did for Mary in her desert when she rested from him, and not when she ran after him by herself; he did it when divine goodness rested in Mary and rested Mary from him, without Mary and for Mary, and Mary then lived from the new fruit that came by the sole operation of God. So she did this tilling, took on the work and the seed, but not the fruit: this is how Mary reached the fullness of her state, not by speaking and seeking, but by being silent and sitting.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 125. La troisième considération porte sur saint Jean-Baptiste

Next, I considered the greatest of the saints, that is to say, the most beloved John the Baptist, he who, though sanctified from his mother's womb, did not concern himself with it. And I marveled that he pointed out Jesus Christ to his disciples so that they might follow Him, while he himself remained silent. And it is not found that Saint John left the desert to go see Jesus Christ in His human nature: he was content with his state, without seeking Him; and divine goodness worked its deeds in him and satisfied him without imposing on him the need to seek His humanity.

And after that, I considered how, when Jesus Christ went to see him in the desert, he refrained from holding Him back in His human person or accompanying Him. Next, I considered him when he preached about Our Lord Jesus Christ; it is said that He sat and took an interest in the sermon of the most beloved John the Baptist, but John the Baptist did not relax his attention, no more than he did before, so occupied was his mind with divinity.

Next, I considered him when he baptized Jesus Christ; in doing so, he touched God the Son, while hearing the voice of the Father and seeing the Holy Spirit. To whom did he reveal this? To whom did he conceal it? Did he take pride in it? Not at all! He only concerned himself with pleasing the One who performed this work in His goodness.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 126. La quatrième considération porte sur la Vierge Marie

Then, I considered the sweet Virgin Mary, she who was so perfectly sanctified; to whom did she show it? To whom did she reveal it? To whom did she hide it? To no one! She did not concern herself with such a great work, and it did not matter to her.

Next, I considered her commitment to virginity: even if the entire world had to be saved, I assert that she would never have consented, even in thought, to abandon her state of virginity, since in His goodness, Jesus Christ could accomplish this through His death.

Then, I considered her when she conceived the Son of God, Jesus Christ, by the virtue of the Holy Spirit. I assert that, in truth, at that moment, she had more knowledge, more love, and more praise of the divine Trinity than all those, apart from her, who are in glory. And why not, Madam? I assert that the good John the Baptist—who, compared to you, Madam, is but a stickleback next to a whale!—was more perfectly filled with divine light from his mother's womb than the twelve apostles were on the day of Pentecost when they received the gifts of the Holy Spirit in abundance; thus you, chosen lady, needed all of that! For I assert that the Son of God, if He had found in you the slightest vanity, even the vanity of being in vain and without necessity the fold of the little ‹meulequin› (which is a small worm), He would never have made you His mother. But, Madam, it was not possible for you to be that, and therefore it was not possible for you not to be His mother.

Then, I considered this lady at the cross, in the presence of the death of her child, when the Jews crucified Him completely naked before her face. Alas! What pity! Who knew better than this lady the righteousness of Jesus Christ? Did she not know well that He was being put to death unjustly? And was she not a mother in knowing it? But, Madam, what ill did your thoughts wish upon them for it? Did you say anything to them, Madam, out of cruelty? What did you do to them, Madam, for the crime they committed? In truth, Madam, if it had been necessary, you would have given your life at that very moment, rather than God not forgive them this misdeed! But it was not necessary, for Jesus Christ was accomplishing this reconciliation so abundantly and so painfully that it sufficed for all. Why so abundantly? Though as little of His blessed blood as could be held on the tip of a needle would have sufficed to redeem a hundred thousand worlds if they had existed, He gave it in such great abundance that none remained; and this consideration made me step outside myself, so that He might make me live by divine pleasure. I also said that He accomplished this reconciliation very painfully; why so painfully? I assert that if all the evils of death and other torments, all those that have been, that are, or that will be from the time of Adam to the time of the Antichrist, if all these evils were gathered together, in truth, it would still be but the pain of a prick compared to the pain that Jesus Christ would have endured from a single prick of a dart or a punch made to His precious and venerable body, and this because of His delicacy, His fineness, His tenderness, and His purity.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 127. La cinquième considération porte sur l’union de la nature

divine to human nature in the person of the Son
After this, I considered how the divine nature united itself for us with human nature in the person of God the Son. Great God! Who could ever imagine such a thing? Who would have the audacity to dare ask and demand it, if His goodness had not accomplished it? That Jesus Christ was poor, despised, and tormented for us is not surprising: He could not refrain from it, given the excess of love with which He loved us; and in His humanity, that was possible. But that the divine nature should take on human nature by uniting with it in the person of the Son, who would have dared to ask for such an enormity? There is enough here to ponder, to be forever freed from ourselves, if only we would let justice work within us. Alas! Why did I not let it do its work? If I had allowed it to do as it pleased, it would have freed me the very moment it gave me this thought about Him; but I did not want it to repair in me the ugliness of my loss. My thoughts have led me through many follies: I thought I could find it through my works, and I do nothing and will do nothing but lose it.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 128. La sixième considération porte sur les tourments de

The humanity of the Son of God for us
After this, I considered how He who was both God and man was shamefully despised for me on earth; and I also considered the great poverty into which He placed Himself for me, and the cruel death He suffered for me. In these three things and in these three points are all His actions both comprehended and incomprehensible. O Truth, Way, and Life! What shall we then think of You? To think of even one of Your benefits for us ignites our hearts with Your love more than the fire of the entire world, of heaven and earth, could ignite to destroy a single corporeal thing!

And then I considered the purity of Truth; it told me that I would not see the divine Trinity until my soul was as free from the stains of sin as that of Jesus Christ, which was glorified the very instant it was created by the divine Trinity, and united to a mortal body and a divine nature in the person of the Son: at the instant it was created and united to these two natures, it was as perfect as it is now. It could not have been otherwise: since His soul was united to the divine nature, His body, being mortal, could not have been any hindrance to it.

I then asked myself who would ascend to heaven. And Truth told me that no one would ascend there except the one who descended from it, namely the Son of God Himself. In other words, no one can ascend there except those who are sons of God by divine grace. And that is why Jesus Christ Himself says that "he who does the will of God my Father is my brother, my sister, and my mother."

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 129. La septième considération porte sur les Séraphins : comment

they are united to the divine will
I then considered the Seraphim, and I asked them about the works that Charity performed through the mystery of the incarnation of the humanity of Jesus Christ, about their creation by the divine Trinity, and about all that Charity would eternally do in creatures out of its goodness for them. But Love told me that none of this mattered to them, except for one thing: the divine will of the divine will of the entire Trinity. And this is a sweet and profitable consideration, which frees one from oneself to approach the state in which one ought to be.
Thus, we have seven considerations that are well-suited for the lost; the first concerns the apostles, the second concerns Magdalene, the third concerns the Baptist, the fourth concerns the Virgin Mary, the fifth concerns the union of the divine nature with the human nature in the person of the Son, the sixth consideration concerns the torments of the humanity of the Son of God for us, and the seventh concerns the Seraphim and their union with the divine will.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 130. Où l’âme parle de trois belles considérations et réflexions

... how she knows of divine power, wisdom, and goodness only what she knows of her own weakness, foolishness, and wickedness.

I will now speak to you of the reflections I made during the life I have just mentioned, that is, in the misguided life, at a time when I did not know how to bear or contain myself.

I began by considering myself, then I considered God, and I viewed myself as if I desired great things for Him; and I praised and rejoiced in these three things more than in all others, and these reflections gave me the way to bear and contain myself.

I considered and first said this: "Lord God, I do not know from where You are, for that is grasped only by Your more than eternal power. Lord, I do not know what You are, for that is known only by Your more than eternal wisdom. Lord, I do not know who You are, for that is grasped only by Your more than eternal goodness."

And in the same way, I spoke thus of myself: "I do not know from where I am: that is grasped by Your power. I do not know what I am: that is known by Your wisdom. I do not know who I am: that is grasped by Your goodness."

And I then spoke thus: "Lord, I do not know from where You are because I know nothing of Your more than eternal power. I do not know what You are because I know nothing of Your more than eternal wisdom. I do not know who You are because I know nothing of Your more than eternal goodness." And similarly of myself: "Lord, I do not know from where I am because I know nothing of my extreme weakness. Lord, I do not know what I am because I know nothing of my extreme foolishness. Lord, I do not know who I am because I know nothing of my extreme wickedness.

"Lord, You are a goodness spread by goodness and entirely within Yourself; but I am a wickedness spread by wickedness and entirely within myself.

"Lord, You are, and therefore all things are accomplished by You, and nothing is done without You; but I am not, and therefore all things are done without me, and nothing is done by me.

"Lord, You are all power, all wisdom, and all goodness, without beginning, without measure, and without end; but I am all weakness, all foolishness, and all wickedness, without beginning, without measure, and without end.

"Lord, You are one God in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; but I am one enemy in three wickednesses, that is, weakness, foolishness, and wickedness.

"Lord, how much can I grasp of Your power, of Your wisdom, and of Your goodness? As much as I can grasp of my weakness, of my foolishness, and of my wickedness!

"Lord, how much can I grasp of my weakness, of my foolishness, and of my wickedness? As much as I can grasp of Your power, of Your wisdom, and of Your goodness! And if I could grasp one of these two natures, I would understand them both; for if I could grasp Your goodness, I would grasp my wickedness; and if I could grasp my wickedness, I would grasp Your goodness: it is the measure of it. And because I know nothing of my wickedness compared to what it is, I know nothing of Your goodness compared to what it is. But the little I know of Your goodness, Lord, is the knowledge I have of my wickedness that gives it to me. And the little I know of my wickedness, Lord, is the knowledge I have of Your goodness that gives it to me. And in truth, Lord, it is still so little that one could say it is nothing rather than something, compared to what remains! And that is why You are everything: Your Truth gives this to me within myself, and that is how I know it."

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 131. Où l’âme dit qu’elle ne veut que la volonté de Dieu

After this, I considered in my wickedness and in His goodness what I could do to appease Him, and I began to meditate, making suppositions and letting my will consent without restraint. Thus, I said to myself that if it were possible that I had never existed, so that I had never wronged His will, if such were His good pleasure, that would be my good pleasure.

I then told Him that if it were possible that I had existed from the moment He did, and that I had been without fault, and that I had from then on endured as much poverty, contempt, and torment as there is goodness, wisdom, and power in Him, provided that I had never wronged His will, if such were His good pleasure, that would be my good pleasure.

Again, I said to myself that if it were possible for me to return to nothingness, just as I came from nothingness, so that He might be avenged of me, if such were His good pleasure, that would be my good pleasure.

And again, I said to myself that if I had at my disposal everything that He has at His disposal, so that nothing could be taken from me or diminished without my own will, I would pour all that into Him and return to nothingness, rather than be able or willing to retain anything that did not come from Him; and even more, for if it were possible for me to have endlessly what I have just said, I could not and would not do otherwise.

Furthermore, I said to myself this: if everything I have just said—that is, having at my disposal everything that He has at His disposal—belonged to my own condition, I would rather that everything go to nothingness without restraint, rather than have anything that did not come from Him; and if I received from Him as many torments as He has power, I would still prefer those torments received from Him to the eternal glory I would receive from myself.

Then, I said to myself in my meditation, that rather than ever doing anything against His good pleasure, I would prefer that the humanity of Jesus Christ suffer as many torments again as He has suffered for me, if it were possible for me to do anything that would displease Him.

Then, I said to myself that if I knew—and that it were the truth—that everything He created from nothing, whether it be myself or anything else—that is, everything—would go to nothingness if I did not wrong His will, everything I have just said would go to nothingness, rather than I wrong Him or wish to wrong Him.

Then, I said to myself that if I knew that I would have to receive endlessly as many torments as He has goodness unless I went against His will, I would suffer them eternally rather than do anything that I knew might displease His will.

And again after that, I told Him that if it were possible for Him to give me all the goodness He eternally possesses, I would love it only for Him; and that if I lost this gift, I would care only for Him; and that if He gave it back to me after this loss, I would take it back only for Him. And if it were possible that it pleased Him that I go to nothingness and have no being at all, rather than receive that gift from Him, I would prefer that, rather than retain it. And if it were possible that I had in my power what He has in His power, and that I had it as well as He does and lacked nothing without my will, but knowing that it would please Him more that I receive from Him as many torments as He has goodness in Him, then I would prefer that rather than retain it.

And even more, I said to myself that if I knew it were possible that the sweet humanity of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the entire heavenly court could not bear that I receive these eternal torments without regaining the state from which I had fallen; and if I knew that God had placed in them—if such a thing were possible—this pity and this will, and that He said to me: "If you will, I will restore to you what you have lost by My will, and I will take you out of these torments because My friends who are in My court wish it; but if it were not their will, I would not restore it to you and you would be in eternal torments, for it is for their love that I restore this gift to you if you wish to accept it"; if I knew all this, I would endlessly fail and remain in torments, rather than accept this gift that I would not receive from His sole will, even supposing that it were through the prayers of the humanity of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the saints that I might regain it. For I could not bear it if I did not receive it from the pure love He Himself bears me in His pure goodness, and from His sole will as beloved towards His beloved.

And after that, I supposed that He asked me how I would behave if I knew that it could please Him more that I love another more than Him; but there, my sense failed me and I did not know what to answer, nor what to want, nor what to reply, and I answered that I would seek counsel.

And after that, He asked me how I would behave if it were possible that He could love another more than me. There again, my sense failed me and I did not know what to answer, nor what to want, nor what to reply.

And even more, He asked me what I would do and how I would behave if it were possible that He could want another to love me more than Him. And similarly, my sense failed me and I did not know what to answer, no more than before, but I continued to say that I would seek counsel; that is what I did, but it was to Him that I asked for counsel! And I told Him that these three things were much more difficult than the previous ones. And I asked Him, my spirit all astonished, how it could be that I should love another more than Him and that He should love another more than me, or that another should love me more than Him. And there, I failed, for I could not answer any of these three things, nor deny them, nor reply anything to them. And yet, He kept coming back to get my answer; but I was so at ease and loved myself so much in being with Him, that I could not contain myself at all nor find the means: I felt closely held, and that is why I advanced with an unsteady step. No one knows this unless they have gone through it. And yet, I could not have peace until He had my answer. But I loved myself so much in being with Him, that I could not answer lightly, whereas if I had not loved being with Him, my answer would have been brief and light! And yet, I had to answer if I did not want to lose both myself and Him, and this plunged my heart into great distress.

Now, I will tell you this answer: I told Him that He wanted to test me on all points. — Alas! What am I saying? Certainly, I did not say a word! It was my heart alone that fought this battle, and it answered in the agony of death that it wanted to withdraw from His love, from which it had lived and from which it thought it should live longer. — But since it was that by supposition He could want this, and since one must want all His will, here is what I answered Him:

(Answer to the three aforementioned questions:) "Lord, if it were possible that the things mentioned above should be eternally in the reality of facts as they are in the reality of questions, I will say for You what I would want from You for the love of You: if I had that very thing that You have with the creation You have given me, so that I am equal to You, Lord, except in that I could change my will for another's—which You do not do—since You would unconditionally want the three things that have been so hard for me to bear and grant, if I knew without doubt that Your will wants it without diminishing Your divine goodness, then I would want it, without ever wanting anything else. And in saying this, Lord, my will comes to an end: my will is a martyr, and my love is a martyr, for You have led them to martyrdom and their thought can do no more. My heart once thought to live endlessly from love by the desire of a good will; but now, these two things in me are finished, which have made me leave my childhood."

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 132. Comment Justice, Miséricorde et Amour viennent vers

When the soul emerged from its infancy,
Then the Land of Liberty appeared, and Justice came to me; and she asked me what favor I desired from her. And I replied that, as I was, I desired no favor, neither from her nor from anything that could torment me.
Then Mercy came, and she asked what aid I desired from her. And I immediately replied that, as I was, I desired no more aid, neither from her nor from anything that could do me good. Then, Love came to me, full of kindness, he who had so often drawn me out of my senses and had ultimately given me death — you have heard something of this! — and he said to me:
"Beloved, what do you desire of me?
I contain all that was, that is, and that will be;
I am filled with all of this:
Take from me whatever you please;
If you desire all of me, I do not oppose it.
Tell me, beloved, what do you desire of me?
I am Love and am filled with all goodness:
What you desire, we desire.
Tell us, beloved, simply your will."
But I immediately replied that I was pure nothingness. Alas! What would I desire? Pure nothingness never had a will! I desire nothing: nothing of Love's goodness matters to me; thus, nothing that comes from it matters to me! Let him be truly filled with it, let him be and let nothing be except through him: I have said that this has completely satisfied me, and thus it suffices me.
I then began to emerge from infancy, and my spirit began to age when my will died and my works were completed, as well as my love that made me frivolous. Indeed, the invasion of divine love, which revealed itself to me through divine light in a very high and brilliant flash, showed me all at once both itself and myself; it was very high, and I was so low that I could not then rise up nor help myself; and from there came what I have of the best. If you do not understand this, I cannot do better: this work is a miracle about which nothing can be said without lying.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 133. Où l’âme dit que les considérations susdites sont pour les

The lost, and it shows again who the lost are, and how these considerations are made in the life according to the spirit.

The soul: You have thus heard certain considerations that I made to unburden myself and find my way. I contemplated this when I was lost, that is to say, when I was troubled; indeed, the lost are all those who have some affection of the spirit, and these considerations are made in the life according to the spirit and by the tender affection of love that the soul bears to itself. But it thinks that it is to God that it bears this love with which it is so strongly affected, whereas, in truth, it is itself that it loves, unbeknownst to it and without realizing it. And there, those who love according to the tenderness of their affection are deceived, for it does not let them come to knowledge. And that is why they remain like children, with the works of a child, and they will remain so as long as they have spiritual affection.

Divine Love, who rests of itself in the annihilated soul: My God! How long is the path, how great the distance from this lost life to the liberated life where Nothing-wanting is lord! And this Nothing-wanting sows the divine seed taken from the divine will. This seed can never fail, but few people are disposed to receive it. I have found many people who have perished in the affection of the spirit, by the works of the Virtues and in the desires of a good will; but I have found few who are nobly lost; and surely, I have found even fewer who are free, that is to say, who lead a liberated life and who are such as this book demands by having the sole will that Pure Love makes one have. Indeed, Pure Love makes one have a single love and a single will, and that is why my will has become a single nothing-wanting. And this Love is only refinement in that it is of the divine work.

This soul is naked, but it does not fear, in this nakedness, that the serpent will bite it. And since God cannot increase His own joy, that of this soul cannot similarly withdraw or grow by its own work; it would have to be that God does it by His own. If its joy withdrew by the work of the soul, it would be there for itself; whereas if it is naked, that cannot be. And since its goodness cannot diminish, evil cannot grow in it by its own work; and if it does not make it grow by its own work, it is because then it would be there for itself; whereas if it is naked, that cannot be.

The free soul: It is true; in this point, I am myself by perfectly abandoning myself, for miracles are due to Faith and give me the true knowledge of divine gifts: Faith is the cause.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 134. Comment l’âme est parfaite en son état lorsque Sainte-

The Church cannot take example from her life
Love: This soul is in the most perfect state, and closest to the Far-Near,
when Holy Church does not take example from her life: she is then beneath
the work of Humility, so that she is beyond the work of Poverty and above
the work of Charity; she is so far removed from the work of the Virtues that she
could not understand their language, even though the works of the Virtues are all
contained within her and they obey her without opposition. But because of this
cloistering, Holy Church cannot know her:
Holy Church praises the fear of God, for the holy fear of God is one of the
gifts of the Holy Spirit; and yet, it would destroy the state of freedom if it could
penetrate it.
Perfect freedom knows no "why." At the point of the sword, the soul
has put to death the pleasures of the body and killed the desires of the spirit. She has
placed all her love under her feet, and she cares no more for it than if it were not:
that which surpasses her has delivered her from the debts she owed to Jesus Christ, and
that is why she owes him nothing, whatever her debt may have been: that which surpasses
her shows her how he has acquitted her of what does not surpass her. But that
which surpasses her, she wants to possess it fully within herself and without any
intermediary. And the great sense of Nature, by which the misguided let themselves be guided
in affection of spiritual life in a struggle against themselves, removes this
abyss from them; that is to say, they cannot understand the nakedness of this abyss, nor
feel in its breadth the goodness of God for them. And that is why they remain
with the works.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 135. Comment sont trompés ceux à qui il suffit de se gouverner en

The affection for life according to the spirit

Oh, how mistaken are those who are content with this! Indeed, all that the creature can do in terms of works of goodness is nothing compared to divine wisdom; and yet, divine goodness does not bestow its goodness upon the soul except because of this very goodness, and a single appearance of this more-than-eternal goodness is worth more than all that the creature can accomplish in a hundred thousand years, or even more than what the entire holy Church can do. And the distance from this goodness is, in reality, a proximity for this soul, for it knows within itself this Far-Near in that it continually places it in the union of its will, without any aversion to whatever may happen to it: everything is equal to it, without any "why," and it itself is nothing in this equality; thus, it has nothing to do with God, just as God has nothing to do with it. Why? Because He is, whereas it is not; and in its nothingness, it needs nothing more, for it suffices that He is and that it is not. It is then stripped of all things, for it is without being where it was before it was. And thus it receives from God what it has, and it is what God is in the transformation through which Love transforms it and returns it to where it was before it came forth from the goodness of God.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 136. Comment toute œuvre est défendue à l’âme anéantie

There, she prays no more than she did before she was one. She receives what she has from divine goodness, from the heart of His love, from that noble ‹Loin-Près›. She concerns herself with nothing, for what she loves most is also what she detests most: such is her mode; there is no more, no middle, or less in her love, and that is why she is not saddened by anything that happens to her. She is of a bottomless depth, and thus she has no proper place; and if she has no proper place, she has no self-love either. Every word, every deed is forbidden to her in the simple being of the divinity, as was once prescribed by Jesus Christ, Son of God. She is at the point where she has no matter for doing good; hence it follows that she has no matter for doing ill either, for Love gives her everything and acquits her towards her neighbor. "It is just," she says, "that all should be subject to me: since all was made for me, I receive everything as mine, without prohibition. And why not? You have loved me, you love me, and you will love me with all your power as Father, with all your wisdom as Brother, with all your goodness as Beloved; and never were you, dear Father, dear Brother, dear and Beloved, even for a moment, without loving me thus: I can therefore truly say that you love no one more than me! For just as your goodness could not bear that your humanity, that she who bore it, that the angels and the saints should not receive the glory of your eternal goodness, it could not bear either that I should receive the pain and torments I deserve; and thus I receive your mercy continually to the measure of your power in all that I should endure."

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 137. Comment cette âme est professe en sa religion, et comment

She has indeed kept the rule.
This soul is professed in its religion, and it has fully adhered to its rule.
What is this rule? It is to be led back through annihilation to the state
in which Love received it in the beginning. It has indeed passed its probationary examination, and it has won the wars that opposed all its powers.
But the one we just mentioned was too strong for it; and this is not surprising, for there is no graver war than a war waged against one's friends: the one who kills them must pass through the edge of the sword. And there, the soul's power is taken away without compensation, but there too all its infirmity is healed.
Oh! What pity for this massacre of the soul's friends who helped it to conquer its enemies, but whom it has ultimately put to death! How can one be surprised? God accomplishes His blessings in His own way, and that is why this soul no longer wishes to remain in this place. Its thoughts were once insolent by placing it in the place of God, but that was because it was outside its proper state.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 138. Comment l’âme retourne à son premier état 1

Thus, the state of this soul is now that of its original state, which is its proper state; therefore, it has left behind three states and united two into one. But when does this unique state exist? This unique state exists when the soul is restored to the simple divinity: it is a simple state of overflowing fruition, in a total knowledge, without feeling and above thought. This simple state operates in the soul through Charity everything it performs, for its will has become simple, and this simple will has no act in itself; and this has been the case since it overcame the necessity of the two natures, when the will was given to the soul for this simple state. And this simple will — which is the divine will — places the soul in the divine state: no one can ascend higher, nor descend lower, nor be more annihilated in humanity. Whoever wishes to understand this, let them beware of the traps of Nature! For just as subtly as the sun absorbs the water from a cloth without anyone, even by looking, noticing it, similarly Nature deceives itself unknowingly if it is not on guard through great experience.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 139. Comment Nature est subtile en bien des points

My God! How subtle Nature is in many ways, when she demands under the guise of goodness and the appearance of necessity that to which she has no right! Yes, what she demands is often dangerous! For with all her cunning, she often receives what is not hers by stealing it herself, through her strength, her vigor, or her charm. I have experienced this to my great misfortune, or rather to my great fortune, when I unknowingly failed to do what I ought according to divine knowledge. This divine knowledge and this rest barred my way to my homeland, hiding the truth from me where I should have taken Humility to know my own. And yet, I lost in this what was mine and what I possessed, but which was never truly mine!

It may well happen that one does not find in a kingdom two creatures of the same spirit; but if by chance these two creatures find each other, they will open up to one another without being able to hide; and even if they wished to hide, they could not, by the condition of their spirit and their temperament, and by the kind of life to which they are called, whether they like it or not. These people have great need to be on their guard, if they have not reached the summit and perfection of freedom! And that is why, if God has given you His high creation, His excellent light, and His particular love, I tell you this in conclusion: be fruitful and increase this creation without failing, for His two eyes are constantly watching you; and if you consider and look at this properly, this gaze makes the soul simple.

Deo gratias
EXPLICIT
Amen.
For the one who wrote this book, From the goodness of your heart I pray you, That the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit You pray, and the Virgin Mary, That after this present life In the company of angels He may render thanks and praises to them.
For the one who wrote this book, From the bottom of my heart I pray you: Pray to the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit; Pray also to the Virgin Mary, So that after this present life, In the company of angels, He may render thanks and praises to them.
Amen.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 71. Comment cette âme n'œuvre plus pour Dieu, ni pour elle-

Love: This soul no longer works for God, nor for itself, nor for its neighbor, as has been said; but let God work in its place, if He wills, He who can do it! And if He does not will it, this soul cares no more for one than the other: it remains always in the same state. Henceforth, the ray of divine knowledge is in this soul; it absorbs it out of itself without itself, in a divine and astonishing peace, struck by an elevation of abundant love from the most-high Jealous One, who grants it everywhere the freedom of a master.

The Soul: Jealous? Yes, jealous, He truly is! He shows it in His works which have entirely stripped me of myself and placed me, without myself, at the divine good pleasure. And this accomplished union of peace joins me and conjoins with me through the sovereign elevation of the creation prepared by the divine being, He from whom I hold my being, for He is the Being.

Love: When this soul is thus absorbed by Him without itself, absorbed by God and for itself, it is a divine operation; and never has there been a work of charity done by a human body that has reached such an operation, or that could have reached it.

The Soul: Understand well the two words of Love, for they are difficult to comprehend for those who do not have the intelligence of their hidden meaning.

Love: It is true, for the work of a creature (understand: the work done by man) cannot be compared to the divine operation, to that which God does in a creature by His goodness for it.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 72. Où l’on parle de la distance qui sépare le pays de ceux qui ont

Perished or lost, from the land of freedom; why the soul retains its will

The Soul: Understand well the two words of Love, for they are foreign to the land of the lost and belong to that of freedom and accomplished peace, the land where those who have reached it dwell.

Love: It is true, I will say a word to them.

The Soul: Yes indeed, despite Will, in which those who have perished and those who are lost dwell, they who thus lead their life of perfection.

Love: When the divine Trinity created the angels through the courtesy of its divine goodness, the wicked ones agreed by their perverse choice to the evil will of Lucifer, who wished to possess by his own nature what he could only have by divine grace. And as soon as they desired this through their disobedient will, they lost the state of goodness. They are now in hell without this state, and without ever recovering through mercy the vision of God. And this high vision, their will made them lose; whereas they would have kept it by giving up this will, instead of holding onto it. And see to what extremity they have come!

Truth: Alas, alas! Why, souls, do you love your will so much, since it is the cause of such a great loss?

Love: I will tell you why the soul retains its will: it is because it still lives according to the spirit, and in a life according to the spirit, there is still will.

Reason: My God! Lord Love, tell me why, since the beginning of this book, you have called this chosen soul, whom you love so much, "soul"; while you say that the lost persons retain their will because they still live a life according to the spirit, why have you so often called it by such a humble name as "soul," which is lesser than that of "spirit"?

Love: Good question! Indeed, to understand well, all those who live a life of grace by fulfilling the commandments and accepting to find their satisfaction in it, truly bear the name of "soul"; not that of "spirit," but that of "soul" because of their life of grace. Indeed, all the hierarchies of paradise do not bear one and the same name, which would allow them to be designated by their highest name; if all are angels, the first angel did not receive the name of Seraphim, but only that of angel, whereas the Seraphim bear both. Understand what this means without saying it. Indeed, I have similarly told you that those who keep the commandments and to whom that is sufficient, receive the name of "soul" and not that of "spirit"; their proper name is "soul" and not "spirit" because these people are far from the life according to the spirit.

Reason: And when then is this soul entirely spirit?

Love: It is when the body is entirely put to death and the will rejoices in shame, poverty, and tribulation: it is then entirely spirit, but not otherwise; then these spiritual creatures know the purity of conscience, the peace of affections, and the intelligence of reason.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 73. Comment il faut que l’esprit meure pour perdre sa volonté

Reason: In the name of God, Lord Love, I ask you to tell me why the spirit must die to lose its will.

Love: It is because the spirit is full of spiritual will, and no one can live a divine life as long as they have will, nor find satisfaction if they have not lost their will. Now, the spirit is not perfectly dead until it has lost the feeling of its love, and the will that gave it life is not dead either; and in this loss, the will reaches its fullness in the satisfaction of divine pleasure; and in this death, the superior life grows, which is always either free or glorious.

Truth: In the name of God, Lord Divine Love, I ask you to show me a soul perfect in this state.

Love: Gladly, and if it is not as I am about to tell you, I recommend that you rebuke it and tell it that it is ill-disposed and unprepared to speak with me in my secret chamber, where no one enters unless they are disposed as you are about to hear me say.

I have no other beloved than the one who fears neither loss nor gain, except only for my good pleasure; for otherwise, she would seek her own interest and not mine, rather than be with me; whereas this my spouse cannot seek her own interest. If she had committed as many sins as the whole world has ever committed, and done as much good as all those who are in paradise, and if all this good and all this evil appeared to the entire people, this soul would feel neither shame nor honor for herself, and she would neither want to hide nor conceal her evil; and if she did otherwise, she would seek her own interest and not mine, rather than be with me. What shame do those in my paradise feel, even if their sins and the gifts of glory they receive from me are seen? Certainly, they do not want to hide their sins at all, they do not feel ashamed that they are known, nor to show my glory.

Truth: But certainly not! They let the master decide whether to hide or show them at his will. And the souls of whom we speak do the same, they who are vessels of this election: the ‹Loin-Près› represents this noble gift to them.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 74. Pourquoi Amour appelle cette âme par un nom aussi humble que

Love: Now, Reason, you ask me why I have given this soul a name as humble as that of "soul." Reason, it is because of your coarseness that I have so often called her by her nickname! And because one understands the hidden meaning of something through a nickname, I have used it, and I will do so again; but her true name is of perfect nobility: she bears the name of "pure," "celestial," and "Bride of Peace." Indeed, she reigns at the bottom of the valley from where she sees the summit of the mountain and from where she sees the mountain from the summit: no one can penetrate between the two; the wise man secures his treasure there, that is, the gift of divine love of unity; and this unity gives her peace and the subtle and marvelous nourishment of the glorious land where her beloved dwells. She no longer feeds on what she possesses, but on the glorious life. This nourishment is that of my chosen bride who is Mary-of-Peace; and she is Mary-of-Peace because ‹Fin Amour› nourishes her. Martha, know this, is too burdened and does not know it; her burdens trouble her, which keeps her far from such a life.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 75. Comment l’âme illuminée fait comprendre les choses

by the example of the transfiguration of Jesus Christ
Understanding of Divine Light: Well then! You who have reason to hide, tell me now, by Love, what you understand in this.
The enlightened soul: What I understand, I will tell you.
The souls who have reason to hide: We understand that Jesus Christ was transfigured on Mount Tabor, where there were only three of his disciples. And he told them not to speak of it and to say nothing until he had risen.
The free soul, to the slaves of Nature, who, nevertheless, hide: Well said! You give me the stick with which I will conquer you! So, I ask you: why did God do this?
The soul that hides: He did it because of us. And since he teaches us this, why should we not do the same?
The [free] soul: Ah! Poor sheep! How animalistic your understanding is! You leave the grain and take the straw! I tell you: when Jesus Christ was transfigured before three of his disciples, he did it so that you would know that few people would see the glory of his transfiguration, and that he shows it only to his intimate friends; that is why there were only three. And this still happens in this world when God gives himself in the ardor of his light to the heart of the creature.
Now that you know why there were three disciples, I will tell you why it was on the mountain: it was to show and signify that no one can see divine things as long as they mingle and occupy themselves with temporal things, that is, things lesser than God. And I will tell you why God told them not to speak of it until he had risen: it was to show that you cannot speak a word of divine secrets as long as you might take vain glory from it; until then, no one should speak of it. Indeed, I assure you, as much as he who has something to conceal or hide has something to show, he who has nothing to show has nothing to hide.

saints, the soul feels no shame for its sins
The Soul: My God, yes! Consider the repentant sinner: she felt no shame when Jesus Christ told her that she had chosen the better and more secure part, and moreover, that it would never be taken from her. And she felt no shame either that her sins were known to all the people, as the testimony of the Gospel itself declares that in the sight of all, God cast out seven enemies from her. She felt no shame towards anyone, except those she had wronged; indeed, she was overwhelmed, enraptured, and possessed, and therefore cared for no one but Him.

And what was the shame of Saint Peter, when God raised the dead by his shadow? And yet he had denied Him three times! Certainly, he felt no shame, but rather it brought him great honor.

What was the shame or the glory of Saint John the Evangelist, when God revealed the true Apocalypse through him? And yet he had fled at the arrest of Jesus Christ!

The Soul: I assert that neither he nor the others felt shame, honor, or a desire to hide or conceal themselves; and that they did not care about what God did through them, for themselves or for the people, even though it was divine work.

These examples are more than sufficient for those who can understand, so that they may grasp what remains to be said, and this book is not written for others.

of His goodness
The soul: As I said, as you can see above, they felt neither shame nor honor for what God did for them, nor did they wish to hide it from anyone.
Truth: But surely, they would not have known why! For they were unburdened of themselves and wholly in God.
The soul: But, in God's name, since He granted them such grace, does He not do the same even now? Would His generosity in giving no longer be what it once was? Would He have set an end and limit to the gifts of His goodness?
Courtesy: Certainly not! His divine goodness could not bear it. For Him to bestow, as in times past, the great gifts He wishes to give, and to grant what has never even been given nor spoken by any mouth and thought by any heart, one only needs to be willing and know how to prepare oneself.
Understand, by Love—Love beseeches you—that Love has so much to give and sets so few limits, that it unites two things into one in an instant.
The soul: But there is one thing I wish to say, not for those who are thus disposed, for they have no need of it, but for those who are not and will be one day (and they do need it!): let them be on their guard, so that if Love asks something of them that He has lent them, they do not refuse it, whatever the result may be, at any hour and whatever Virtue Love sends to be the messenger. Indeed, as messengers, the Virtues carry Love's will in letters sealed by their lord, just as the angels of the third hierarchy do.
And all those to whom Love sends His messengers, let them also know that if they refuse what the Virtues ask from within—which must have lordship over the body—they will never make peace with the sovereign who sent them, but will be taken back and troubled in their understanding, and burdened with themselves due to lack of trust. For Love says that it is in great need that one recognizes a friend.
Reason: Here, answer me: if he does not help in need, when then will he help? Tell me then.
Love: And if I do not remember, what is so marvelous about that? I must keep the peace of my divine justice and render to each what is theirs; not what is not theirs, but what is.
[To the soul:] Now, understand the hidden meaning of this book. Indeed, a thing is worth as much as it is appreciated and needed, and no more. Now, when I wanted to need you (I say "need" to the extent that I ask it of you) and it pleased me, you refused me in several of my messengers; this, no one knows but me, and me alone. I sent you the Thrones to correct you and give you orders, the Cherubim to enlighten you, and the Seraphim to inflame you. Through all my messengers, I instructed you of my will and the states in which I asked you to be—and they made it known to you—but you still paid no heed.
Seeing this, I left you to your own guardianship to save yourself; whereas if you had obeyed me, you would have been different, by your own testimony. Yes, you will indeed save yourself, but it will be in a life burdened with your own spirit, and it will never be entirely unburdened, for you did not obey my messengers nor the Virtues when I wished through them to unburden your body and free your spirit; and because you did not obey when I instructed you through the subtle Virtues I sent you and through my angels whom I pursued you with, I cannot rightfully give you the freedom I have, for Justice cannot do that. Yes, while I was instructing you, if you had obeyed the will of the Virtues I sent you and my messengers whom I pursued you with, you would have rightfully had the freedom that is mine. Ah! Madam, how burdened you are with yourself!
The soul: It is true, my body is full of weakness, and my soul is full of fear, for I am often anxious according to these two natures, whether one wills it or not, whereas free persons are not and cannot be.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 78. Comment ceux qui n’ont pas obéi aux enseignements de

Those who strive for perfection remain encumbered by themselves until death.

Love: Yes, weary soul, you have much trouble and little gain! And all this because you did not obey the teachings of perfection with which I pursued you to unburden you in the flower of your youth; nevertheless, you never wanted to change, and you wanted nothing to do with it. You rather always rejected the requests I made known to you through messengers as noble as those you have just heard about.

[To the listeners:] These people remain encumbered by themselves until death. But assuredly, if they had wanted, they would have been delivered from that which they are and will be in very great servitude for a small profit... If they had wanted, they would have been delivered for little. Yes, truly, it would have sufficed for them to give themselves where I wanted them, and I showed them this through the Virtues whose office it is.

I said that they would have been absolutely free in soul and body if they had followed my advice expressed by my Virtues, but they refused my will and what they needed to do, rather than I penetrate them with my freedom. And because they did not do what they needed to do, they have entirely remained as you hear it said, and encumbered by themselves. Those who are free, annihilated, and adorned with delights know this well, and they see for themselves the slavery of others. Indeed, the true sun shines in their light, so much so that they see the dust in the sunbeam thanks to the brilliance of the sun and its ray. And when this sun is in the soul with these rays and these splendors, the body no longer feels weakness nor the soul fear, for the true Sun of Justice has never healed a soul without healing the body when performing miracles on earth; and He still often does so now, but not for those who have no faith.

Thus you can see and hear that he who trusts in God is great, strong, very free, and unburdened of all things, for then God sanctifies him.

I have just spoken of those whom I pursued from within so that they would obey the perfection of the Virtues and who did nothing of it, that they will remain encumbered by themselves until death; I add this: if they strove every day to achieve the perfection of the apostles by the application of their will, they would not be unburdened of themselves—let no one expect it!—neither in body nor in soul. No; and better still: since harshness and internal pursuits do not lead to this, there is nothing more to be done. Indeed, everything one does with oneself is entirely encumbered by oneself: let all those who undertake to work with themselves without the fervor of internal effervescence know this.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 79. Comment l’âme libre conseille de ne point s'opposer à ce que

The good spirit asks
The free soul: If I tell all those who strive for the perfect life to be on their guard, it is so that they do not refuse what the ardor of the desire of the will of the spirit demands, however dear it may be to them to reach what is best and follows this life, which is called the "wandering life" and the "life according to the spirit."
Love: I have said that they should be on their guard, because they need it if they want to come to what is best and reach it; this life is its domestic and servant, and it prepares the inn to host, at its coming, a state as great as the freedom of nothing-wanting, a state in which the soul will be entirely satisfied, I mean: satisfied with that nothing which gives everything. Indeed, he who gives everything possesses everything, and no one else.
The soul: Yes, but I would like to say this again to those who are lost: he who, as I have said, keeps himself in peace and perfectly accomplishes the will of the ardor of the cutting desire of the operation of his spirit, by holding his senses so tightly that they have no operation by virtue of deliberations foreign to the will of the spirit, that one would then come, as a legitimate heir, closest to the state we are speaking of.
Love: This soul would be the eldest daughter of the Most High King, lacking nothing lovable. And this lady has reached the state we are talking about where it is most noble, and I will tell you how: nothing is empty in her that is not entirely filled with myself; and that is why she can harbor neither anxiety nor remembrance, so that she no longer has any image within her. However, Pity and Courtesy are not far from this soul when needed, that is, in their time and place.
The soul: It is right that Pity and Courtesy are not far from me, for they were not far from Jesus Christ either, through whom I have life again; and although his sweet soul was glorified as soon as it was united to a mortal body and a divine nature in the person of the Son, Pity and Courtesy nevertheless remained in him. Whoever would be courteous would love only what he should; now, he has never loved the humanity of the Son of God, who loves him temporally, and he has never loved him divinely, who loves something corporeally; for those who love his divinity feel little of his humanity: never has he who feels it corporeally been conjoined or united to him, nor has he been divinely filled by it. And what would one feel? If God did not move, nothing else would move either! Now, understand nobly the hidden meaning of this.
Reason: Yes, that such souls are strong is clear in the case of the Baptist.
Love: Was he ever weak and burdened with himself?
The soul: Certainly not! Love does not destroy, but rather instructs, nourishes, and supports those who trust in it, for it satisfies, it is an abyss and an overflowing ocean.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 81. Comment cette âme ne se soucie ni d’elle-même, ni de son

Love: Thus, this soul takes its rightful name from the nothingness where it dwells. And since it is nothing, it cares for nothing, neither for itself, nor for its neighbor, nor even for God. Indeed, it is so small that it cannot be found; and every created thing is so distant from it that it cannot feel it; and God is so great that it cannot grasp Him; and because of this nothingness, it has come to the security of knowing nothing and wanting nothing. And this nothingness we speak of gives it everything, and no one can possess it otherwise.

This soul is imprisoned and detained in the land of perfect peace, for it is always in complete satisfaction; it swims, it dives, it bathes, and overflows with divine peace, without moving from within or acting outwardly: these two things would take away this peace if they could penetrate it; but they cannot, for the soul is in a state of sovereignty, and therefore they cannot trouble or disturb it in any way. If it does something outwardly, it is always without itself; if God works His work in it, it is from Himself in it, without it and for it. And this soul is no more burdened by this than its angel is by guarding it, for the angel is no more burdened by guarding us than if he did not guard us. Indeed, this soul is no more burdened by what it does without itself, than if it did not do it, for of itself, it has nothing: it has given everything freely, without any "why," for it is the lady of the spouse of its youth, who is the resplendent sun that warms and nourishes the life of what is and what comes from his being. This soul has neither remained in doubt nor in sorrow.

Reason: But how is this possible?

Love: By a sure alliance and a true agreement to desire only divine dispositions.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 82. Comment cette âme est libre par ses quatre quartiers1

The soul that has reached this state perfectly is free in its four quarters. Indeed, a man must have four quarters of nobility before he can be called a gentleman, and the same applies in a spiritual sense. The first quarter by which this soul is free is that it has no reproaches within itself, even if it neither performs nor engages in the works of the Virtues. In the name of God, understand if you can, you who listen! How could it be that the exercise of Love is accompanied by the works of the Virtues, when the works must cease where Love is exercised?

The second quarter is that it has no will, no more than the dead in their tombs, except only the divine will. This soul cares neither for justice nor for mercy: it establishes and places everything in the sole will of the one who loves it. This is the second quarter by which this soul is free.

The third quarter is that it believes and asserts that there was, is, and will never be anyone worse than itself, or who is better loved by the one who loves it as it is. Note this and do not misunderstand it!

The fourth quarter is that it believes and asserts this: just as God cannot will anything other than what is good, neither can it will anything other than His divine will. Love has so enriched it with Himself that He makes it assert this, He who, by and through His goodness, has transformed it into this goodness; He who, by and through His love, has transformed it into this love; He who, by and through His divine will, has purely transformed it into this will. He is this very thing of Himself and in Himself for it; and this, it believes and asserts, and otherwise it would not be free in all its quarters.

Understand the hidden meaning of this, listeners of this book, for therein lies the grain that nourishes the bride: this applies insofar as she is in the state where God makes her be, where she has given her will and therefore can only will the will of the one who, of Himself and for her, has transformed her into His goodness.

And if she is thus free in all her quarters, she loses her name, for she attains sovereignty. That is why she loses it in the one with whom she merges and in whom she abandons herself, by him, in him, and for herself, just as water that comes from the sea and receives a name, for example, the Oise, or the Seine, or another river: when this water or this river returns to the sea, it loses its course and the name under which it flowed through many lands performing its work; now that it is in the sea and rests there, it has lost this toil. The same goes for this soul; you have enough of this example to find the hidden meaning of its story: it came from the sea and received a name, then it returns there and thus loses its name, and it has no other than that of what it is perfectly transformed into, that is, the love of the bridegroom of her youth, he who has transformed the bride entirely into himself: he is, therefore she is; this suffices her wonderfully, she is therefore amazed by it; he is Enjoying Love, she is therefore love, and this delights her.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 83. Comment cette âme reçoit le nom de la transformation en

which Love has transformed her
Love: Now, this soul is nameless, and that is why it receives the name of the transformation into which Love has transformed it, just as the waters we have spoken of receive the name of "sea," for there is nothing but the sea once they have entered it.
And there is no nature of fire that does not draw some matter into itself, for fire makes one single thing of itself and the matter — not two, but one; it is the same with those we speak of: Love draws all their matter into itself, and Love and these souls are one and the same thing — not two, for there would then be discord between them, but one single thing, and thus, there is concord.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 84. Comment l'âme libre par ses quatre quartiers accède à la

sovereignty and lives freely of divine life
Love: I said that the soul which is thus free by its four quarters, then attains sovereignty.
Reason: Alas! Love, is there no higher gift?
Love: Indeed, there is one, and it is its nearest neighbor; for when it is thus free by its four quarters and noble in all the branches that descend from it—no ‹vilain› is taken in marriage, and that is why it is absolutely noble—the soul then comes to an astonishment that is called "the nothing-thinking of the near Far-Near." Henceforth, it no longer lives only of the life of grace and the life according to the spirit, but also of divine life, freely—not gloriously, for it is not glorified, but divinely. Indeed, God has then sanctified it by Himself; and there, no one can enter who is contrary to goodness.
[The author, to the listeners:] Understand this properly, for it holds as long as this soul is in this state; may God grant you to be continually in it without departing! I say this to those for whom Love has made this book, and to those for whom I have written it. But you who are not of it, nor were, nor will be, you would waste your effort trying to understand it: one cannot taste it, who either is not in God without being, or does not have God in him while being. Understand the hidden meaning of this, for what nourishes is what tastes good; it is often said: "Bad taste poorly nourishes!"
Reason, she who is encumbered: Surely, that is well said!
The soul, seized in the nothing-thinking by this near Far-Near which delights it in peace: Truly, no one could say or think the coarseness and encumbrance of Reason! It is clearly seen in its disciples! A donkey who would listen to them would find nothing to object to! But God has well kept me from such disciples! They will not hold me in their counsel, and I no longer want to listen to their doctrine, for I have adhered to it too long, even if it has been good for me. Now, I have better, though they do not know it, for a narrow mind cannot appreciate a thing of great value or understand what Reason does not master; or if it understands, it will still not often be well! And that is why I say that I no longer want to listen to their coarseness; let them speak of it no more, I can no longer endure it! and I neither have the means nor the reason for it. And this is a work of God, for God works His work in me: I owe Him no work, since He Himself works in me; and if I added my own, I would undo His work. And thus the disciples of Reason would want, if I believed them, to bring me back to that poverty of their counsel. But they waste their effort, for it is an impossible thing; however, I excuse them for their good intention.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 85. Comment cette âme est libre, plus que libre, parfaitement libre

Love: This soul is free, more than free, perfectly free, supremely free, at its root, in its trunk, in all its branches, and in all the fruits of its branches.

This soul has as its inheritance a perfect freedom; each of its quarters is adorned with it on its plain. It answers to no one if it does not wish to and if they are not of its lineage, for a nobleman would not deign to respond to a commoner who called or summoned him to a battlefield; and that is why, whoever calls this soul does not find it: its enemies receive no reply.

The Soul: That is just. Since I believe God is within me, He must remember me; His goodness cannot lose me.

Love: This soul is flayed alive in being put to death, it is set ablaze by the ardor of the fire of charity, and its ashes are cast into the high sea by the nothingness of its will. It possesses a lovable nobility in prosperity, a high nobility in adversity, and an excellent nobility in all places, whatever they may be. One who is such no longer seeks God, neither in penance, nor in the sacraments of the Holy Church, nor in thoughts, nor in words, nor in deeds, nor in creatures below, nor in creatures above, nor in justice, nor in mercy, nor in glorious glory, nor in divine knowledge, nor in divine love, nor in divine praise.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 86. Comment Raison est émerveillée de ce qui est dit de cette âme

Reason: My God, my God, my God! What is this creature saying? This is enough to astonish the entire world! But what will those whom I have nourished say? I would not know what to tell them or how to respond to arrange this!

The Soul: That does not surprise me! For in all that pertains to this state, they are indeed people who have feet but no path, hands for doing nothing, a mouth but no speech, eyes but no light, ears for hearing nothing, reason for not reasoning, a body for not living, and a heart for understanding nothing. That is why those whom you have nourished go from surprise to surprise!

Love: Yes, truly, these are surprises by which they are greatly surprised! Indeed, they are too far from the land where one practices this exercise to be at its level; whereas those who are there, who belong to the land where God lives, they are not surprised by it.

The Liberated Soul: Ah no! God forbid! For that would be a vile thing; I will tell you and show you how by an example: if a king made to one of his loyal servants a gift so great that he would be rich forever without ever serving again, would a wise man be surprised by it? He certainly should not be, for that would be to blame the king, the gift he made, and the one who is freed by this gift.

Courtesy: And I will tell you in what and why: it is because a wise man is not surprised that one does what one ought to do; on the contrary, he praises, appreciates, and loves it; and if he were surprised by it, he would show thereby that something inappropriate had been done. Whereas the vile of heart and the small of mind, because he does not know, for lack of sense, what honor and courtesy are nor what the gift of a noble lord is, is greatly surprised by it.

Truth: It is not surprising, he is indeed the cause, as you have heard.

The Liberated Soul, in the nobility of her unity: By God! How could someone sensible be surprised that I speak of great and new things, and that I find everywhere, in everything and in all things, my full satisfaction? My beloved is great, he who makes me a great gift, and as he is always new, he renews this gift for me; and as he is himself filled and satiated with the abundance of all goods, I am filled and satiated with the abundance of delights that overflow from his divine goodness, without seeking it with pain and effort in the satisfactions of which this book speaks. He is, and that is what satiates me.

Pure Courtesy: That is entirely right. It is fitting for the lover, since he is worthy, to satiate his beloved with his goodness.

Martha is troubled, Mary is at peace;
Martha is praised, Mary is even more so;
Martha is loved, Mary is much more so.

Mary has but one spirit within her, that is to say, a single intention, which brings her peace; but Martha has new ones all the time, so that her peace is constantly troubled; and for all that, the free soul can have but one intention.

This soul hears all the time what she does not hear;
She sees all the time what she does not see;
Thus she is all the time where she is not;
Thus she feels all the time what she does not feel.

And she then possesses her beloved and says:

The Soul: I possess him, for he is mine. I will not let him go: he is in my will. Come what may, since he is with me, it would be my fault to worry.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 87. Comment cette âme est souveraine des Vertus et fille de

Divinity
Love: This soul is sovereign of the Virtues, daughter of Divinity, sister of Wisdom, and spouse of Love.
The soul: It is true, but this seems to Reason a surprising language. This is not a marvel, for soon, she will be no more; whereas I am and will always be without failing, for Love has neither beginning, nor end, nor measure, and I am nothing but Love: how then could I have any? That cannot be!
Reason: My God! How dare you say such a thing? I dare not listen, and truly, Madam, I falter at hearing you... my heart fails me! I am dying!
The soul: Alas! Why has she not been dead for a long time! For as long as I possessed you, Lady Reason, I could not freely enjoy my inheritance nor what was and is mine; but now, I can enjoy it freely since I have mortally wounded you by love!
Yes, henceforth, Reason is dead.
Love, to this soul which is Love itself and nothing but Love, since Love, in its divine goodness, has cast under its feet and put to death without return Reason and the works of the Virtues: I will tell you what Reason would say if she were alive in you, and what she would ask of you, who are our beloved.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 88 Comment Amour demande ce que Raison demanderait si elle

was alive, namely, who is the mother of Reason and the other Virtues.
Love: I will tell you what Reason would ask if she were alive: she would ask who her mother is and that of the other Virtues, her sisters, and if they in turn are mothers to anyone.
(Answering himself:) Yes, all the Virtues are mothers.
The soul: But of whom? Of Peace?
Love: Of Holiness!
The soul: So, all the Virtues, who are sisters of Reason, are mothers of Holiness?
Love: Yes, but of that Holiness which Reason understands, and not of another.
The soul: And who then will be the mother of the Virtues?
Love: It is Humility, but not the humility that is such by the work of the Virtues, for this one is a true sister of Reason—I say "sister" because a mother is more than her child, infinitely more, as you can see for yourself.
The soul, speaking in place of Reason: And where then is the Humility that is the mother of these Virtues? Whose daughter is she, and where does she come from to be the mother of such a great lineage as that of the Virtues, and grandmother of Holiness, of which the Virtues are mothers? Who then is the ancestor of this Holiness? Can no one say where this lineage comes from?
Love: No; he who knows it knows nothing that can be put into words.
The soul: It is true, but I would rather lie than say nothing about it!
This Humility, who is grandmother and mother, is the daughter of divine majesty, so that she is born of Divinity. Deity is her mother, and the ancestor of her branches, whose offshoots produce abundant fruit. We will remain silent about it, for speaking of it spoils it. This Humility has given the trunk and the fruit of these offshoots: this is why the peace of this Far-Near approaches it, he who frees it from all operation. Speaking damages it, thinking darkens it. Far-Near frees it and nothing burdens it anymore: it is free from all service and lives in freedom.
He who serves is not free;
He who feels is not dead;
He who desires, wants;
He who wants, begs;
He who begs falls short
Of divine contentment.
But those who are always loyal to her, they are always overwhelmed by Love, annihilated by Love and completely taken by Love; thus they care only for Love, even if they suffer and endure forever torments as great as God is great in His goodness. And never did she love subtly, the soul who would doubt that this is the truth!

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 89. Comment cette âme a tout donné dans la liberté de sa noblesse

Love: This soul has given everything in the freedom of the nobility of the work of the Trinity: in it, it establishes its will with such renunciation that it cannot sin unless it tears itself away. And if it has nothing with which to sin, it is because no one can sin without will. Therefore, it has no need to guard itself as long as it leaves its will where it is established, that is, in the one who had freely given it in his goodness; but he wanted, in return, to receive it at his beloved's prayer, free and stripped, without any "why" on her part, and this for two reasons: because he wills it, and because he deserves it. Thus, it has not known abundant and continuous peace until it has been purely stripped of its will.

This soul is like someone who is always drunk: one who is drunk cares for nothing that happens to him, in whatever form events come, no more than if they did not happen to him; and if he did care, it would mean he was not truly drunk. Similarly, if this soul has anything to will, it is poorly established and can still fall when adversity or prosperity assails it. It is then not "whole," since it is not nothing as long as it has something to will, and its poverty and wealth lie in wanting to give or retain.

I would like to say this to all those, whether they want it or not, whose desire calls and beckons them inwardly towards works of perfection accomplished by cultivating Reason: if they wanted to be what they could be, they would come to the state we are talking about, while at the same time being lords over themselves, over heaven, and over earth.

Reason: How so, "lords"?

The free soul, which possesses everything without setting its heart on it — for if its heart feels it, it is not there: That, no one can say.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 90. Comment on peut venir à la perfection en faisant le contraire

from his will
Love: I have said that he who obeys the request arising from within his spirit—if he is prompted to a good will, for otherwise, I do not say it—if he abandons all his external will to live a life according to the spirit, he will also come to complete lordship.
The spirit, which seeks this even in its misguided life: In the name of God, tell us how!
The liberated soul: This, no one can tell, except he alone who is such in his creature by his goodness for her. But I can indeed tell you that, before reaching this point, one must perfectly accomplish the opposite of his will and nourish the Virtues to the brim, and stand firm without faltering so that the spirit always has lordship without contradiction.
Truth: My God! How could the body be ill, whose heart harbors such a spirit?
The liberated soul: I dare say that this will—and it must be had in the misguided life, that is, in the life according to the spirit—would spoil in a brief instant the humors of all diseases: such is the remedy of the spirit's ardor.
Love: It is true! Let him try it, who doubts, and he will know the truth! Now, I will tell you this: contrary to what happens for the liberated soul, the life we have spoken of and which we call "life according to the spirit," cannot find peace if the body does not always do the opposite of its will; it must be understood that these people do the opposite of what their sensuality desires, and otherwise, if they did not live contrary to their good pleasure, they would fall back into the perdition of this life. But those who are free do the exact opposite: indeed, just as one must do, in the life according to the spirit, the opposite of his will to not lose peace, conversely, those who are free do everything they please to not lose peace, since they have come to the state of freedom, that is, since they have fallen from the Virtues into Love, and from Love into Nothingness.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Mirror > Chapitre 115. Où l’on parle de la substance éternelle ; comment Amour

There engenders the Trinity in the soul
[The author:] There is an eternal substance, a communicable fruition, an intimate conjunction: the Father is the eternal substance; the Son is the communicable fruition; the Holy Spirit is the intimate conjunction. This intimate conjunction proceeds from the eternal substance and the communicable fruition and it is made through divine love.
The soul invaded by divine goodness: Yes, Unity, you engender unity: Unity reflects its ardor in unity; and this divine love of Unity engenders in the annihilated soul, in the liberated soul, in the glorified soul, the eternal substance, the communicable fruition, and the intimate conjunction. From this eternal substance, memory receives the power of the Father; from this communicable fruition, understanding receives the wisdom of the Son; and from the intimate conjunction, the will receives the goodness of the Holy Spirit, goodness which conjoins it in the love of the Father and the Son. This conjunction establishes the soul in the being without being which is the Being, and this Being is the Holy Spirit itself which is the love of the Father and the Son. This love of the Holy Spirit flows into the soul and spreads in abundance of delights, through the unique and eminent gift that the sovereign Beloved makes in a very chosen and masterful conjunction, when he gives himself in his simplicity by making himself simple. And he gives himself in simplicity in that he shows that there is nothing outside of him, from whom all things derive their being, so that there is nothing outside of him in love, which is light, union, and praise: there is only one will, one love, one operation in two natures, one goodness, thanks to the conjunction wrought by the force of the transformation of love of my beloved, the boundless domain of the overflowing of divine love, divine love that the divine will exercises in me and for me, without me possessing it.

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Notes > Miroir, cf. par exemple Hadewijch :

...to be loved or hm, refusal, desire, gain or loss, convenience or discomfort, profit, harm, honor and shame, to be with God in celestial consolations, or in the pains of hell: this fire makes no distinction.
It consumes everything it touches: damnation or blessing, it is no longer a matter of concern, I assure you.
(Mengeldichten, XVI, trans. Porion)
The source of this indifference, which has often scandalized, and which we have said elsewhere is not insensitivity but impassibility (cf. supra, ch. 16, note 5), is the true nature of happiness: it is to love, says the Mirror, or to be with God, says Hadewijch, whatever the circumstances of this union with God; so much so that the only decisive questions after examining all the trials of love — and ultimately, the trial of hell — will be the following (cf. end of ch. 131): and if God preferred that I love another rather than him? and if...

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Notes > Dieu préférait aimer un autre que moi ? et si Dieu préférait qu’un autre que moi

I love him more than myself? Behold, in all mystical literature, the only true trial of which all others are but a faint echo, a dizzying point where one must risk everything and where all human freedom is at stake before that of God: here, it is clear that love is a gift or it is not. Thus, it is in this gift and radical surrender that "the soul emerges from its infancy," and "there the Land of Freedom was shown" (cf. the entire ch. 132).

41, 2. From here until the end of ch. 43, it is we who add between [ ] the distinction of the two Churches; cf. supra, Prologue, note 5, and Introduction, p. 18, and infra, ch. 43, note 1.

41, 3. The link of this reply with what precedes is difficult to grasp; perhaps there is a gap in the text.

43, 1. "Indeed, Holy Church, beneath this Holy Church!" Here we find the starting point of the distinction between the two Churches, one supporting the other; cf. Introduction, p. 18.

43, 2. In other words: Sainte-Eglise-la-Petite.

43, 3. In other words: Sainte-Eglise-la-Grande, or even both Churches at once.

43, 4. "... through the gloss of our scriptures." A frequent expression in the Mirror to express not an esoteric meaning, but a secondary meaning of Scripture, a meaning linked to Love and Sainte-Eglise-la-Grande as opposed to the meaning linked to Reason and Sainte-Eglise-la-Petite. (And beyond that, the Mirror uses "the gloss" alone — which we translate as "hidden meaning" — to refer to the understanding that proceeds from Love and not from Reason.)

This distinction needs to be placed in the context of medieval exegesis and the functioning of Scripture as a "speculum," a Mirror with multiple reflections (since here below, says Saint Paul, we know "per speculum in enigmate," in a mirror, enigmatically, 1 Cor 13:12). Medieval exegetical technique cannot be summarized in a few lines; suffice it here to note the principle of a multi-level reading of Scripture, which we borrow from Alexander of Canterbury — a few decades before the Mirror — insofar as he clearly shows in this whole the place of a spiritual reading for the "perfect," analogous to what the Mirror seems to suppose:

(The author comments on Cant 1:4 — "the king brought me into his cellar" — and sees the different barrels of the royal cellar as so many meanings of divine Scripture.) "The drink contained in the first barrel, that is, in history, is simply the deeds and examples of the saints... In the second barrel, that is, in allegory, is found the teaching of faith... In the third barrel, that is, morality, is found the instruction of morals... In the drink contained in the fourth barrel, the one at the bottom, that is, anagogy, is found a very sweet perception [affectus] of divine love; by its ineffable sweetness, our soul is filled and united in a certain way to the highest divinity... Those who are simple and crude [simpliciores et rudes] in faith and love, usually drink from the first barrel... Those who are more advanced [capaciores] drink from allegory, those who are more advanced still [perfectiores] from morality, and the perfect [perfectissimi] from anagogy, that is, from contemplation... and whoever has tasted even a little of it will be immediately drunk." (P.L. 161, 707-8.)

43, 5. A classic theme of courtly literature; in a context very close to that of this chapter, Hadewijch expresses it thus: "Who risks everything for love, Love itself will reward with love." (Strofische Gedichten, XVII.)

45, 1. "Yet it would be nothing, in regard to this understanding, to that which one could compare it, but that one does not put in that comparison neither his power, nor his sense, nor his knowledge, nor his goodness." We translate according to the general sense of this most convoluted paragraph.

47, 1. Allusion to Mt 6:22-23 or Lk 11:34.

47, 2. Possible allusion to Rev 20.

48, 1. These last two replies are practically incomprehensible in the original; we interpret them according to the Latin version.

49, 1. Cf. Lk 12:1-4.

50, 1. "... who knows the secrets of the Son through the love of the Holy Spirit, who has given this Soul to him." We interpret according to the Latin and English versions.

51, 1. The whole paragraph alludes to the episode of Esther and Ahasuerus in Est 15:9-15, abundantly exploited by the Christian spiritual tradition.

52, 1. "... to this precious pearl." Beyond the classical identification of the soul with a precious pearl, Marguerite Porete may discreetly sign her work here.

52, 2. This indication absent from the original seems necessary to us for the understanding of the reply.

52, 3. "... she lives, and endures, and is, and was, and will be without being." One could also understand "without being" absolutely, since only God is (cf. supra, Prologue, note 6); we prefer to follow the English ("... without her being").

52, 4. This new exploitation of the image of fire (cf. supra, ch. 25, note 1) is very close to that made by Saint Bernard in the De Diligendo Deo; it is found barely modified in ch. 83.

52, 5. "He is, this does not escape him; and I am not, and yet I do not lack." The theme of nudity, developed in this chapter and elsewhere (cf. for example ch. 94; 111 and notes), rests on this assertion that "I am not" (cf. supra, Prologue, note 6); it is fundamental in all Nordic mysticism to express the truth of the soul before God as a condition of their mutual donation. Cf. for example the pseudo-Hadewijch: ... there, a simple thing is revealed to him, which cannot be: pure and naked Nothingness. It is in this nudity that the strong stand; at once rich in their intuition and failing in the ungraspable... In the intimacy of the One, these souls are pure and naked internally, without images, without figures, as if freed from time, uncreated, released from their limits in the silent latitude." (Mengeldichten, XVII, trans. Porion.)

52, 6. We add this indication while the original continues without interruption.

52, 7. Cf. Mt 8:22.

53, 1. "... very noble stone in the breadth of the plain of truth." The only plausible meaning seems heraldic, the "plain" being the lower sixth of the shield. Heraldic images will be found again in ch. 82 ff.

53, 2. and 3. "... death of all mortifying deaths."

54, 1. "... the two deaths [by which] this Soul is dead to death."

54, 2. Presumably the mountain of Love at the end of ch. 9.

55, 1. Here it is about those who have perished, while the second kind will be those who are lost, which will be discussed in ch. 57. On the distribution of the different "lives" in the Mirror, cf. Introduction, p. 35.

55, 2. This last sentence being grammatically incomplete in the original, it is we who add "they think."

56, 1. The term bougre originally designated a member of a Manichean sect born in Bulgaria in the 10th century; later identified with the Cathars and Albigensians who inherited it in part, the bougre gradually came to designate all members of the so-called "Free Spirit" sects, from which Marguerite Porete formally distances herself here while seeming to warn against a possible confusion.

56, 2. The grammatical gender change of love between the 13th century and today (cf. Introduction, p. 31) forces us, in this paragraph, to replace "mistress, daughter and mother" with "master, son and father."

57, 1. The mention here of "merchants" actually refers to ch. 63.

58, 1. On this distribution of the spiritual itinerary into "states," cf. Prologue, note 6, and Introduction, p. 35.

58, 2. The original reads mere; we prefer the Latin magister.

58, 3. The ‹Loin-Près› will henceforth take an increasing place in the Mirror: it gradually reveals itself as the true partner of the soul, at once the closest and the most distant, the most known and the least known; it is the one whose paradoxical experience is that of love itself. Cf. already the Prologue: "this distant love, while being so close within her, was so far outside..."

As for the very expression of ‹Loin-Près› (Loingprés in the original), we have encountered it at the time of the Mirror in the pseudo-Hadewijch (Mengeldichten, XVII) and in the passage of the Dreifaltigkeitslied cited at the head of this work and where all its characteristics are summarized; Father Porion (Hadewijch of Antwerp, p. 136) notes it in an anonymous writer from Strasbourg, and Romana Guamieri (Il Movimento del Libero Spirito, p. 490) shows a striking resurgence in Marguerite of Navarre in the 16th century.

58, 4. "... peace upon peace of peace."

58, 5. Here appears the crucial question for the Christian spiritual tradition of the relationship between the mystical state and the state of glory: is there continuity, even identity, between them? Is there a more or less fleeting ecstatic state that would introduce the mystic into the beyond? Every mystic has been made to say everything on this point! We cannot even summarize the positions in this edition. Let us simply note that the Mirror, if one compares ch. 61, 91, 92, 97, 118, notably, gives a simple answer, the one that will always make the agreement of the spirituals of the tradition authenticated by the Church: 1) the state of glory is other than all the states here below, including the most mystical; and for that matter, the seventh state of the Mirror is radically distinct from the fifth and sixth mentioned here. 2) The experience of glory is indeed that of the mystic — it is the "divine life" or "clarified life," or "glorious life" in the terminology of the Mirror — but according to a mode that is not that of eternity. At the junction of time and eternity, of the fifth and seventh state, the experience of the flash (of the touch, other mystics would say) marks in the sixth state the contact of the uncreated and the created: it is from there that all mystical experience diffuses in duration (Cf. already the end of ch. 9). The difference between mysticism and the beyond is therefore not in the object (glory in both cases), but in the mode (temporal or eternal) of its perception. 3) Hence the spiritual's rift between time and eternity, between action and act (= the movement of the flash), a rift that is that of the less and the more (cf. supra, ch. 11, note 4), the one that makes him live outside himself, that of the ‹Loin-Près› itself and which will make a Teresa of Avila say: "I die because I do not die..." (Cf. already Beatrice, 3rd way of loving.)

Between the seventh and the sixth state, the Mirror generally introduces the distinction made here between glory and clarity (sometimes translatable only as "illumination") that proceeds from it — notably thanks to the play on words flash/clarity —, two terms whose relationship is traditionally close and rooted in the Latin clarificare, simultaneously glorious and luminous (applied for example to Christ in Jn 17: "Holy Father, glorify (= clarifica) your Son so that your Son may glorify (= clarificet) you." From one to the other spreads all mystical language as an impossible covering of eternity by time, and it is there that the spiritual's experience joins that of the Passion of Christ, which Saint John precisely identifies with his clarificatio. — On the whole of this question, we allow ourselves to refer the reader to our Lectures of

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Notes > Jean de la Croix, Paris, 1981, 2e lecture : Temps et désir.

59, 1. Cf. above, ch. 27, note 1.
59, 2. "... no soul can speak of this precious enclosure, from which it is obliterated by the annihilation of the knowledge that this annihilation brings to itself.
59, 3. It is we who add "with" based on the context.
60, 1. "... this understanding is strong and subtle and very noble (which the sanguine are naturally aided by); and without the haste of the cutting will of the ardor of the spirit's desire, the choleric are naturally aided by this." The entire passage is almost incomprehensible, likely altered in the original. We translate it based on the general sense of the Latin version. As for the "cutting will of the ardor of the spirit's desire," which is found in equivalent formulas in ch. 60, 79, 94, 118, among others, it characterizes the will in the "life according to the spirit" (cf. Introduction p. 35).
Moreover, the characterology alluded to here by the Mirror (we will find it again in ch. 99) has been classic since Galen. It considers four dominant "humors" in man, which oppose each other in pairs parallel to the four elements (cf. above, ch. 5, note 5): choleric (due to bile), characterized by promptness to inflame and strength of will; lymphatic, or phlegmatic (due to phlegm), characterized by indolence and weakness; melancholic (due to black bile), characterized by sadness; sanguine (due to blood), characterized by cheerfulness and inconstancy.
60, 2. The staging is a bit complicated throughout this chapter. We add here "to the listeners" insofar as the soul does not respond to Love, but rather seems to apologize for its lengthiness to the listeners, as Love did a little earlier.
61, 1. On these seven states, cf. Prologue, note 6.
61, 2. "... in the freedom of charity." One could also understand: "freed from charity," in light of ch. 65.
62, 1. This chapter logically follows ch. 60, with ch. 61 seeming rather like a parenthesis.
62, 2. We translate this sentence from the English, as the corresponding French passage ("... but yet they want to do nothing about it.") is unclear.
63, 1. Allusion to a difficult-to-identify Gospel passage, perhaps Luke 22, 28-29.
64, 1. In the original, the previous sentence, against all likelihood, is already attributed to Love.
65, 1. The mountain is the one at the end of ch. 9.
65, 2. Classic sentence of spiritual literature based on the wordplay: anima - animare - amare = soul - to give life - to love.
66, 1. "... it will not be long before she comes to an end," these two replies—perhaps interpolated?—fit poorly into the context.
66, 2. "... wrapped in love."
67, 1. Cf. above, ch. 14, note 1; and below, ch. 85, note 2.
69, 1. "... for the gift of him cannot be given in form."
69, 2. Based on Gen 30, 1-5; 35, 16-20; Ps 67, 28, the opposition of Rachel and Benjamin becomes, for the spiritual tradition, that of discursive knowledge and contemplative knowledge; both actually stem from a single desire for God—thus the Mirror does not condemn Reason as long as it stays in its place (cf. for example ch. 65)—but according to two different and discontinuous qualities; hence the necessary disappearance of Reason when union with God becomes immediate. Cf. for example the same allegory developed by Richard of Saint-Victor a century before the Mirror:
This gift [= contemplation] comes from God, and not from man's merit. But without a doubt, no one receives such a great grace without immense zeal and ardent desire. Rachel knows this, and that is why she increases her zeal and inflames her desire more each day. Indeed, in this tension of daily effort, in this immensity of pain, Benjamin is born and Rachel dies, for when man's spirit is taken above himself, he surpasses all the narrowness of human reasoning: all human reason succumbs to the contact of what it sees of the divine light when it is elevated above itself and taken in ecstasy. What then is the death of...

## Mirror of Simple Souls — Living Archive Edition > Notes > Rachel, sinon la défaillance de la raison ? Ainsi, à la naissance de Benjamin,

Rachel dies, for the spirit, enraptured in contemplation, experiences the complete failure of human reason (Benjamin Minor, ch. 73-74).
69,   3. Cf. Jn 4, 20-24.
70,   1. On the entirety of this chapter, cf. Prologue, note 6.
70,   2. Here, it would undoubtedly be necessary to introduce another interlocutor, due to the change in grammatical person.
70,   3. On the innocence of Adam before sin, cf. infra, ch. 94, note 2. Moreover, the Latin and English versions add a few words here whose meaning is as follows: "... except for those who are naked and forgotten, for they have nothing to hide."
71,   1. "And such a union of complete peace joins and unites me through the sovereign height of the creation of the apparatus of the divine being, from which I have being, which is being."
71,   2. "... the intention of the gloss": this again refers to the understanding of the "perfect"; cf. supra, ch. 43, note 4.
72,   1. Cf. supra, ch. 62.
72,   2. On the angelology of the Mirror, cf. supra, ch. 5, note 3.
72,   3. Cf. supra, ch. 62.
73,   1. These are the 5th and 6th states of ch. 61.
73,   2. Allusion to ch. 2 and 5 of the Book of Esther.
74,   1. Cf. end of ch. 9.
74,   2. "His dangers cannot but lead to a glorious life." A difficult phrase to interpret.
74,   3. Wordplay: "... she is Mary of peace, and therefore is Mary of peace, that Fine Love nourishes her." The opposition between Martha and Mary, supported by Lk 10, 38-42 and Jn 11, traditionally illustrates the superiority of the contemplative life over the active life. This will be encountered several times in the Mirror (ch. 86; 124), and it is absolutely universal in spiritual literature.
Moreover, the same tradition generally — perhaps rightly — conflates the evangelical characters of Mary, sister of Lazarus, and Mary Magdalene (cf. for example ch. 76 and 93 of the Mirror). It should be noted that the numerous references in the Mirror to Mary Magdalene reflect the growing importance of her cult and hagiography in the 13th century.
75,   1. Cf. Mt 17, 1-9; Mk 9, 2-10; Lk 9, 28-36.
75,   2. "... And since he teaches us this, why should we not do it?" The connection of this phrase with the context is unclear. Perhaps it should be understood as: "since it is he who teaches us to hide — like the disciples at the

77, 1. "… not for those who are in a state,..." We translate according to the general sense of the passage.
77, 3. Idem. The original reads "aorner" = adorn; we prefer to follow here the Latin and English versions, more in line with the classical attributions of the Thrones. Moreover, this entire chapter shows the relationship between the Virtues and the virtues of the soul: one is the result of the announcement of God's will made by the other to the conscience. Cf. ch. 105.
78, 1. Original: "... by the Virtues, who have this office." We translate according to the Latin and English versions, which are more logical within the context.
78, 2. It can be noted that this image, treated in extremely similar terms, will become central in Saint John of the Cross to illustrate the growth of the soul in lucidity in the mystical experience (Cf. Ascent of Mount Carmel and Dark Night).
78, 3. Appellation of the Messiah in Mal. 3:20.
78, 4. This last sentence is obscure in the original; we follow the Latin version.
79, 1. The entirety of this reply seems to refer to the Prologue.
79, 2. The end of this chapter is somewhat disjointed; we use the Latin to follow the general sense.
79, 3. This allusion to John the Baptist takes on meaning in ch. 125.
80, 1. The "chant" and the "descant," at a time when polyphony is emerging in European music (the Mirror is contemporary with the Play of the Greensward by Adam de la Halle), contrast plainchant with contrapuntal ornaments that form a kind of musical commentary, generally left to the initiative of the cantor.
80, 3. "... in which I am melted"; "liquefaction," a technical term in mystical literature, often referred to in Cant. 5:6 ("My soul melted when he spoke"), expresses the effect of the immediate contact of God and the soul when it reverberates in its faculties and reorients them, a true divine fertilization of the soul that henceforth engenders Trinitarian life; it is here that the exemplarist schema of the three powers of the soul (cf. supra, ch. 9, note 1; and infra, ch. 85, note 2) reveals its full scope, developed here in the reply of Astonishment.
81, 1. "... without any why." The expression frequently recurs in the Mirror (for example in ch. 91, 111, 134) to indicate the absolute gratuitousness of love. Cf. the pseudo-Hadewijch: "... the innumerable multitude of 'whys' that make me prefer you above all things escape me, Lord, when I turn in nakedness towards you alone, loving you without why, you yourself for yourself" (Mengeldichten, XVIII, trans. Fr. Porion).
Fr. Porion notes regarding this text the diffusion of this precise expression throughout the mystical current to which the Mirror is connected: it is found as such in Beatrice, Ruusbroec, Eckhart, Jacopone da Todi, and even in Catherine of Genoa.
81, 2. The original reads "the bride," not "the groom," but the context implies the masculine — which is confirmed by the end of ch. 82 — even if the feminine expression clearly comes from Mal. 2:14-15, here paralleled with Mal. 3:20 (the sun of righteousness) already encountered (cf. supra, ch. 78, note 3).
82, 1. "How this Soul is free from its four sides." From here until ch. 85, the Mirror introduces numerous allusions to court life, particularly to heraldry (cf. already ch. 53). Moreover, this chapter and the next, without role indication in the original, see the general staging of the Mirror gradually fade and eventually disappear (cf. infra, ch. 107, note 1).
82, 3. Obscure passage: "He is, from whom this is; and it marvelously suffices him, from whom this is marvelous, and it is pleasing Love, from whom this is love: and it delights her." We use the Latin: "Iste est ergo ista est et istud eam contentât, etc."
Moreover, this image of the river that comes from the sea and returns to the sea losing its name is already present in pseudo-Dionysius. It is developed repeatedly throughout the subsequent tradition.
84, 2. "... not thinking from afar nearby."
84, 3. "... either in God without being, or God in him in Being."
85, 2. One notes the parallel between this reply and the author's own end... (cf. Introduction, p. 26). One also notes the final reduction operated by the annihilation of the soul: the Trinitarian operation itself (knowledge, love, and praise — cf. supra, ch. 9, note 1) vanishes in favor of a union with God upstream of the differentiation of divine persons (cf. supra, ch. 80, note 3), that is to say at a point where this differentiation will somehow depend on the spiritual itself, holder of God's divinity. It is in him that the Father will beget the Son, says Eckhart — which surfaces in ch. 67 of the Mirror. This theme is central in all northern mysticism, and it is akin to that of nakedness (cf. supra, ch. 52, note 5) and our return to our uncreated origin (cf. infra, ch. 111 and notes); more explicitly, cf. for example Eckhart:
[Commenting on Lk 10:38: "Jesus entered a stronghold..."] "… so truly one and simple is this little stronghold, so elevated above all mode and all powers is this unique one, that no power or mode, nor God himself can ever look into it. In all truth, and as truly as God lives, God himself will never penetrate it for a moment, has never yet penetrated it with his gaze according to his mode and the property of his Persons...; as he is One and simple, he comes into this one that I call a little stronghold in the soul, otherwise he does not penetrate it in any way, thus only he penetrates and dwells there. By this part of herself, the soul is like God, and not otherwise." (Sermon 2, trans. J. Ancelet-Hustache).
86, 1. "... and so it is all new, and gives me a new gift." At the heart of the mystical experience, the perception of God's gift as continual novelty (ch. 106: "His goodness for me always gives me new love.") is a constant feature of spiritual literature; cf. for example Hadewijch:
May new light give you new zeal, new works, fullness of new delights, new assaults of love and a new hunger so vast that eternally new love devours its new gifts! (Strophic Poems, XXXIII, trans. Fr. Porion)
86, 2. "... without seeking it through pain or towing in its fulfillments, which this book describes." Perhaps one should see here an allusion to the consolations of ch. 26?
88, 1. The Mirror here clearly distinguishes without opposing holiness, daughter of virtues and Reason (and thus daughter of man), and the experience here described as supreme peace and daughter of God. Cf. Introduction, p. 17.
88, 2. Here begins a passage in very rhythmic prose rich in alliterations, without being able to speak of proper verse, except in the last sentence.
90, 1. This liberation through self-mastery — and not through destruction — involves two phases (sometimes too schematically opposed in ascetic and mystical, forgetting the unity of the growth process of a single love), one where God and the soul are perceived as competitors, the other where they are perceived as co-operators. Hence the apparent contradiction of this chapter, in truth one of the most classic in the spiritual tradition; cf. for example Saint John of the Cross:
To come to taste all, desire to taste nothing;
To come to possess all, desire to possess nothing;
To come to be all, desire to be nothing;...
... To come to what you do not taste, you must go by a way in which you do not taste;
... To come to what you do not possess, you must go by a way in which you do not possess;
(Ascent of Mount Carmel, I, 13)
To come to what you are not, you must go by a way in which you are not..."
Forgetting this prerequisite, in the following chapters of the Mirror as in Saint John of the Cross, could and can obviously only lead to the gravest accusations of quietism (Cf. Introduction, pp. 26 ff.).
93, 1. Cf. Jn 20:11-17 — Here and in ch. 124, the Mirror alludes to the legend according to which Mary Magdalene withdrew for thirty years to the desert of Saint-Maximin. One must also see the pseudo-Dionysian and Eckhartian theme of the desert where the reunions with God take place at the end of the mystical journey.
93, 2. The original reads: "when love began," which seems incompatible with the context. We restore according to the general sense.
93, 3. Wordplay: "she was grieved, and not Mary."
94, 1. Jn 14:12 — The somewhat unclear relationship of this citation with the context becomes clearer in ch. 113.
94, 2. This return to the state of innocence lost at the original sin (in reference to Gn 2-3; cf. supra, ch. 70, and infra, ch. 133) combines with the theme of nakedness (cf. supra, ch. 52, note 5), the mystical awareness being ultimately that of the "normal" state of man after the denunciation (= annihilation, according to the terminology of the Mirror) of all his spirit's wanderings. In this sense, the soul re-united with God can literally no longer sin, a frequent and often scandalous assertion of the Mirror. But again, the scandal is only possible for those who forget that the Mirror speaks here of a restoration, not a destruction of man. Understood thus, the innocence of Adam regained is also a universal theme of mystical literature; cf. for example the anonymous corrector of the Spiritual Canticle of Saint John of the...

100, 2. The original reads "motz"; we suppose "morts" in reference to the three deaths of ch. 54.
100, 3. "... of this clear life." Cf. supra, ch. 58, note 5.
101, 1. "I have done everything."
101, 2. "and therefore I have so much being that it can be from him." This phrase is almost incomprehensible, both in the original and in the various versions.
102, 1. Cf. Gn 2, 7.
103, 1. Title absent from the original; we borrow it from the table of chapters.
103, 2. Cf. Prv 24, 16.
105, 1. Cf. supra, ch. 77, note 3. Our division into uppercase V and lowercase v seeks to render the relationship between ‹Vertus› (angelic) and virtues (of the soul), at the risk of some arbitrariness.
106, 1. "Why would anyone know, except he who I am, who in me is the same? It is the Secret Love, which is beyond peace." Beyond this difficult passage, the entire reply is enigmatic.
107, 1. From now on until the end of the Mirror, the stage play tends to fade in favor of a more didactic literary genre. As a result, we will attribute entire passages to the author, without further explanations (except in ch. 122, note 2) and without indicating a specific interlocutor, even if it is the audience of listeners.
109, 1. Here, the registers of unity and equality intersect in an untranslatable way: "... everything is one to me from that one who is one. This point makes me one, and otherwise I would be [two], soon if it mattered to me, for I would be with [myself]" (... [two]... and... [myself], absent from the original, are supposed based on the versions).
109, 2. "... if it does not remain in us, without seeking." We interpret according to the context.
110, 1. The two replies concerning this "art" use strange terminology and involve a poorly defined theory of knowledge. Perhaps the passage is lacunary?
110, 2. "skill" = "‹engin›" ("ingenium" in the Latin version).
110, 3. What seems to be opposed in this obscure reply is, on the one hand, the contemplative knowledge of God in its immediacy and passivity, its "substantial" nature; and on the other hand, its discursive and mediated, theological knowledge.
110, 4. The meaning of the sentence supposes distinguishing between Love and love, even if, fundamentally, there are not two loves, but two modes, one perfect (annihilation), the other imperfect (the fourth state of ch. 118), of a single love.
110, 5. Cf. infra, p. 197.
110, 6. "... and thus is such being without her."
110, 7. "It is the fulfillment of his pilgrimage, and the annihilation of his rendering of his will, which is returned to her."
111, 1. Cf. supra, ch. 81, note 1.
111, 2. The theme of nudity and innocence (Cf. ch. 52, note 5; ch. 85, note 2; ch. 94, note 2) now combines with that of a free and conscious recapture of our pre-created being in the "more" (Cf. supra, ch. 11, note 4) at the end of the entire history of the soul; cf. already in ch. 51: "This soul must be similar to divinity, for it is transformed into God, whereby its true form is maintained, which is granted and given to it without beginning by the one who has always loved it in his goodness" (supra, p. 115); cf. also ch. 35). This is found in similar terms throughout northern mysticism; in a very similar context, cf. for example the pseudo-Hadewijch: "Those who do not disperse into other works than the one described here, return to unity in their Principle; ... In the intimacy of the One, these souls are pure and naked inwardly..." (Mengeldichten, XVII, trans. Porion; cf. also XVIII, supra, ch. 81, note 1).
111, 3. The general meaning of this reply seems to be an opposition similar to that at the beginning of the previous chapter (cf. supra, ch. 110, note 3): those who can listen or speak cannot understand, and vice versa.
112, 1. "... pleasant goodness"; difficult to translate; cf. Latin "acceptabilem sive gratam."
112, 2. "... amiable love...". Cf. supra, ch. 9, note 1; ch. 85, note 2; and infra, ch. 115 and note.
113, 1. Jn 14, 12; cf. supra, ch. 94.
114, 1. "... to the clarified...": cf. supra, ch. 58, note 5.
115, 1. The soul gives God to God by becoming the abode of the Trinity: this is what the Augustinian exemplarism was preparing for a long time (cf. supra, ch. 9, note 1) to account for the mystic's awareness of the mystery of our divine adoption. The theme is further developed in ch. 117: it is the infinite void of my sin that allows God to proportionally make his abode in me, an idea also very Augustinian and which will be at the heart of Luther's intuition about man's inability to save himself.
117, 1. This "very high Spirit" seems in fact to be the soul itself.
117, 2. "Nature," in this entire passage, is obviously to be taken in the spiritual sense of Paul's experience of an inner struggle of man simultaneously sinner and saved, belonging to God and to the flesh (Cf. Ro 7, 14-25), and not in the Manichean philosophical sense of a good God and an evil creature (as emphasized supra, ch. 115 and note).
117, 3. Cf. supra, ch. 115, note 1. The entire passage from "Otherwise, if he had not..." to here is missing in the original; we translate it from the Latin version.
117, 4. The wound of perfect love healing the wound of imperfect love is a universal theme in courtly and then mystical literature; cf. for example the romance of Jauffré, a Provençal emulator of Chrétien de Troyes: "the wounded [by love] must seek how to wound the one who wounded him, for otherwise nothing can heal him" (verses 7287-7289).
This theme here combines with that of the wound of Christ's heart on the cross, the source of all grace in the Gospel according to Saint John, very present in the tone of this paragraph.
118, 1. Cf. supra, Prologue, note 6.
118, 2. Promise made at the end of the Prologue — The "emprise" is the challenge issued by the knight for the love of his lady, which will lead to some feat of arms, here the conquest of the soul.
118, 3. Cf. ch. 74 and end of ch. 9.
118, 4. "... and each degree has its foundation."
118, 5. "... and encumber oneself with multiple beings, to unencumber oneself, to reach one's being."
118, 6. The passage "... equality... remove" is missing in the original. We borrow it from the Latin version. Moreover, this paragraph and the next suppose a distinction between two states of the "will" in the soul, one positive (divine will), the other negative (the "own will") as long as it does not join the first from which it fundamentally originates. We attempt to untangle these two situations of the will by using V and v.
118, 7. Cf. supra, ch. 117, note 2.
118, 8. Probably an allusion to the Magnificat: "He has brought down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted those of humble estate, etc."
118, 9. "And because the Bridegroom of her youth, who is [only] one, does not want more than one..." — On the relationship between the Sun and the Bridegroom of youth, cf. supra, ch. 81, note 2.
118, 10. "... who clarifies..." — Cf. supra, ch. 58, note 5.
118, 11. "everything is his own, but his own self."
118, 12. Cf. supra, ch. 118, note 2.
119, 1. "Ah, unknown ladies, who are in being, and in being without separating from the unknown Being, truly unknown are you."
119, 2. Probably the three great stages of the spiritual life (lost, wandering, liberated) that structure the Mirror and correspond to the three deaths of ch. 54.
120, 1. Chapters 120, 121, 122, praise and love song of the soul, are written in a more or less versified prose, sometimes very rhythmic and rich in alliterations, sometimes almost flat. We have tried to preserve these variations in the translation, and we arrange the text respecting as much as possible a cadence close to the original.
121, 1. Cf. supra, ch. 12, note 2.
121, 2. The "song" of the soul, like the previous chapters and the versified interludes already encountered (cf. supra, ch. 6, note 1), constitutes again a true verbal juggling, more than a constructed poem: the rhythm, sometimes slow, sometimes fast, is that of an acrobat; the meter, sometimes almost regular, sometimes absent, the whimsy of the alliterations are those of a parlor game. Translating precisely all the nuances of such entertainment is impossible, and we did not attempt it; however, it must be said that the author here deliberately indulges in ease, and one would betray him by adhering to a too elaborate version.
122, 1. On the beguines, cf. Introduction, p. 20.
123, 1. The following considerations (up to ch. 132 inclusively), practically without role indications, escape even more than the previous chapters the scenic play to which the Mirror pretends (cf. supra, ch. 107, note 1). After the conclusion that the soul's song constituted in a certain way, their lyricism, contrasting with the complication of the previous chapters, and the unity of their development invite us to consider them as a separate treatise, despite a very strong thematic and linguistic link with the whole. Perhaps we are in the presence of a reuse in the Mirror of a text previously elaborated by its author.
123, 2. Jn 16, 7.
123, 3. "The seeing of this hearing..."; we rather suppose "indeed."
123, 4. The seven gifts of Is 11, 2-3, which traditionally structure God's action in the soul of the Christian and the spiritual. Cf. infra, ch. 134.
124, 1. On the identification of Mary and Magdalene, cf. supra, ch. 74, note 3 and ch. 93, note 1.
124, 2. Cf. Jn 20, 11-13. On the sun, cf. supra, ch. 78, note 3.
124, 3. "... by the affection of the tenderness surprised by the spirit of you."
124, 4. Cf. Lk 8, 8.
124, 5. "... and virtues make perfect works." We translate thus according to the context, despite the singular of the verb.
124, 6. On Mary's rest and the legend of Mary in the desert, cf. supra, ch. 74, note 3, and ch. 93, note 1.
125, 1. On this entire passage, cf. Jn 1, 29-37.
125, 2. Cf. Mt 3; Mk 1, 2-8; Lk 3, 18.
125, 3. Cf. Mt 3, 13-15; Mk 1, 9.
126, 1. Cf. Lk 1, 28.
126, 2. Cf. Lk 1, 35.
126, 3. Probably a local term, further explained by the parenthesis.
128, 1. "In these three deeds and point[s] are all his deeds included without including."
128, 2. Cf. Jn 14, 6.
128, 3. Cf. Jn 3, 13.
128, 4. Mt 12, 50; Mk 3, 34-35.
131, 1. We borrow this last proposition from the English version, as neither the original nor the other versions give a satisfactory sense here.
131, 2. "... I was not walking the amble." Literally: I was not walking the amble.
131, 3. Cf. supra, ch. 41, note 1.
132, 1. Ditto.
133, 1. Wordplay: "... I contemplated when I was merry, that is when I was distressed."
133, 2. Cf. supra, ch. 94 and notes.
133, 3. Perhaps an allusion to the end of the previous chapter.
134, 1. Cf. supra, ch. 81, note 1.
134, 2. Cf. supra, ch. 11, note 4.
134, 3. From here, two folios are missing from the original manuscript, that is, up to note 1 of chapter 137. We supplement from the English version (which ends the Mirror at the end of ch. 136) and the Latin version, generally preferring the variants of the Chigiano C IV 85 manuscript in R. Guarnieri's edition. As for the titles, they come from the table.
135, 1. Cf. supra, ch. 111 and notes.
136, 1. Cf. supra, ch. 69.
136, 2. Cf. supra, ch. 9, note 1.
137, 1. Here resumes the French text.
137, 2. Wordplay: "... His thoughts were once overthought..."
138, 1. Cf. supra, ch. 111, note 2.
138, 2. "... and so he left three, and made two one." It is about the return of the soul to its origin after the three lives and the three deaths of ch. 53-54 and following.
138, 3. "... which simple will has no deed in it, since it has overcome the necessity of two natures, where will was given for simple being." These two natures seem to refer to the fifth state of ch. 118.
139, 1. "... in passing what I had to do or know divinely, without my knowledge."
139, 2. "... in covering the matter." This last chapter of the Mirror is one of the most obscure.
139, 3. Cf. Gn 1, 28. The conclusion of the Mirror is particularly enigmatic here as it addresses the members of Sainte-Eglise-la-Petite (cf. Introduction, p. 18). On the recognition of the spiritual among themselves, cf. supra, ch. 20 and 98.
